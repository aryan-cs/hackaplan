Most models forget every conversation as soon as it ends. Inspired by how humans form connections between experiences, we built a system that lets AI remember, relate, and reason over time. MorphMind was born out of the idea that memory shouldn’t just store it should evolve."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"MorphMind is a multimodal memory layer built on Morphik. It ingests text, images, and audio, extracts entities and relationships, and constructs a living knowledge graph that grows with every interaction. This enables AI models to recall prior context, connect related ideas, and reason across modalities — turning isolated prompts into long-term understanding."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Morphik for multimodal embedding and storage, FastAPI for backend ingestion, and Neo4j to represent entity relationships. OpenAI and Claude models handle reasoning, summarization, and entity extraction. On the frontend, React , Tailwind , and D3.js visualize the evolving knowledge graph in real time. For audio inputs, Whisper handles speech-to-text conversion. Each new input updates Morphik’s vector store and dynamically reshapes the graph to reflect learned associations."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Designing a unified schema for text, image, and audio embeddings. Maintaining real-time synchronization between Morphik’s vector space and the Neo4j graph. Balancing context recall depth without overwhelming the model prompt window. Integrating multiple APIs under tight time constraints during the hackathon."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Building a fully functional memory layer that links multimodal data through knowledge graphs. Achieving real-time graph visualization where each node represents an evolving “memory.” Demonstrating contextual recall — AI could reference prior conversations and images accurately. Creating a demo that made AI feel more “alive” by giving it continuity and context."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"True AI memory isn’t just about storage — it’s about structured recall and contextual reasoning . Graph-based visualization helps debug and understand how AI forms relationships. Multimodal embeddings from Morphik unlock cross-domain connections that text-only systems miss. Collaboration across AI reasoning, graph theory, and UX design is key to building intelligent systems."},{"heading":"What's next for MorphMind","content":"We plan to extend MorphMind into a persistent memory API that any LLM can plug into. Upcoming features include:\n\nTemporal decay and relevance weighting for human-like forgetting. User-specific memory graphs for personalized assistants. Integration with Notion, Gmail, and Drive for contextual data ingestion. Reflection cycles that let the model summarize and reorganize its own knowledge.\n\nOur vision: to make MorphMind the foundational memory layer for all intelligent agents — a system that remembers, connects, and grows with you."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"claude morphik"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Coffee Beans AI","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/coffee-beans-ai","tagline":"Build a tournament to find the best coffee shops near you using AI powered search!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/944/230/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Anthropic x Maryland Hackathon","hackathon_url":"https://anthropic-maryland-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Honorable Mention"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"claude","url":null},{"name":"nextjs","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"coffeebeansai-1.vercel.app","url":"https://coffeebeansai-1.vercel.app/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"The Problem","content":"We've all been there: you're in a new city or neighborhood, overwhelmed by dozens of coffee shop options on Google Maps.

We had to implement dual fallback: try EXIF first, then use live GPS. Platform Migration : Midway through, we migrated from React Native to native Swift for better performance and iOS integration. This required rewriting the entire frontend while maintaining API compatibility. Location-Based Tiebreaking : Initially, we only used CLIP confidence scores, but this led to ambiguity when multiple similar items existed. We developed a sophisticated tiebreaker algorithm that uses GPS distance when confidence scores are close. Cross-Platform Path Handling : Hardcoded Windows paths broke on macOS. We solved this with dynamic path resolution using os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)) . Image Format Inconsistency : The backend originally only searched .jpg files but accepted all formats. We expanded to .jpg , .jpeg , and .png to ensure all uploads are searchable."},{"heading":"Accomplishments We're Proud Of 🏆","content":"✅ Successfully integrated OpenAI CLIP for semantic visual search ✅ Built a beautiful, native iOS app with smooth animations and intuitive UX ✅ Implemented intelligent location-aware matching that combines AI with geography ✅ Created a robust filename-based metadata system that survives database-free deployments ✅ Achieved <2 second search times even with hundreds of images ✅ Extracted EXIF GPS data from photos for automatic location tagging"},{"heading":"What We Learned 📚","content":"Technical Skills:\n\nHow transformer-based vision models like CLIP work and how to optimize them for real-time use SwiftUI's declarative paradigm and state management patterns CoreLocation API and handling iOS permission workflows Image metadata standards (EXIF, IPTC) and extraction techniques Implementing distance calculations with the Haversine formula\n\nDesign Insights:\n\nThe importance of fallback mechanisms (EXIF → GPS → manual entry) How confidence thresholds affect user trust in AI systems The value of visual feedback during async operations (uploading, searching)\n\nProduct Development:\n\nWhen to use AI vs. traditional algorithms (AI for matching, math for distance) The critical importance of location context in physical-world applications Native vs. cross-platform trade-offs in mobile development"},{"heading":"What's Next for Beacon 🚀","content":"Real-Time Notifications : Push alerts when a potential match is found Interactive Campus Map : Visual display of where items were found User Authentication : Account system for tracking your reports OCR for ID Cards : Automatically extract names from student IDs Machine Learning Pipeline : Retrain CLIP on campus-specific items for better accuracy Multi-Campus Support : Scale to universities nationwide Blockchain Integration : Immutable proof-of-finding for high-value items Social Features : Thank and rate finders, build reputation scores"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"clip core-location flask numpy openai pillow python pytorch swift swiftui"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"News2Trade","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/news2trade","tagline":"Our app uses NewsAPI and Claude to summarize trading news and provide actionable stock recommendations, helping users make smarter, faster decisions.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/944/256/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Anthropic x Maryland Hackathon","hackathon_url":"https://anthropic-maryland-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most Learned Skills in Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"claude","url":null},{"name":"fastapi","url":null},{"name":"newsapi","url":null},{"name":"ts-+-react-frontend","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/learningtocodekg/claude"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Our team, Vishnu Gunturi (Computer Science, Freshman), Pranav Patil (Computer Science, Freshman), and Kanish Gupta (Computer Science, Freshman), built a project that summarizes trading news and provides stock trade recommendations using NewsAPI and the Claude API.
