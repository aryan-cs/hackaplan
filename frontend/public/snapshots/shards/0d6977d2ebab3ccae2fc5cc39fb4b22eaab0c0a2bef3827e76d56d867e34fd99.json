This also provides the flexibility of exploring surrounding or follow-up content very naturally."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We took advantage of Lantern's optimized vector database technology to power our queries, making this platform both efficient and scalable. We used Prisma as an ORM to populate and interact with the database, which is an extension of PostgreSQL.\n\nOpenAI's GPT API was used to generate text embeddings, both for the query as well as for preprocessing our repository of course content. We aggregated lecture transcripts into minute-long segments to be embedded and persisted in the database. A query finds the closest match of the user's question to a given moment in a lecture, of which the top results are then presented to the user in order of closeness.\n\nWe utilized NextJS for our framework, and experimented with different CSS effects and styling such as carousels, glassmorphism, and the dark-mode trend. We queried from our LLMs the closest videos in their vector embeddings to our input, fetched from our backend the videos necessary to display, and presented the videos through Youtube Embeds."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"A large part of the project was getting the vector embeddings from the data. We had to source for the course content in a format that was amenable to pre-processing, and we eventually settled on the lecture transcripts with timestamps, which we could design our own scripts for aggregating for our needs. It also took some initial setup to integrate our project with Lantern, because of how new the technology was, but once we got it working it made database nearest-neighbor queries very natural and efficient."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Muse provides a unique and revolutionary new approach to combining the benefits of a formal, structured college-style education with the convenience and functionality of a search query. It leverages OpenAI's LLMs to obtain a more accurate result that is most relevant for the user's needs, and does so in a seamless user interface that is both easy to use and looks amazing."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to use GPT to obtain state-of-the-art text embeddings and how to integrate this into a web-based service.

We leverage LLMs to translate text to SQL. The model is preprocessed to specifically handle Intersystems IRIS SQL syntax. We chose Intersystems as our database for storing electronic health records (EHRs) because this enabled us to leverage their integratedML queries. Not only can healthcare workers generate fully functional SQL queries for their datasets with simple text prompts, they now can perform instantaneous predictive analysis on datasets with no effort. The power of AI is incredible isn't it.\n\nFor example, a user can simply type in \"Calculate the average BMI for children and youth from the Body Measures table.\" and our app will output\n\n\"SELECT AVG(BMXBMI) FROM P_BMX WHERE BMDSTATS = '1';\"\n\nand you can simply run it on the built in intersystems database. With Intersystems IntegratedML, with the simple input of \"create a model named DemographicsPrediction to predict the language of ACASI Interview based on age and marital status from the Demographics table.\", our app will output\n\n\"CREATE MODEL DemographicsPrediction PREDICTING (AIALANGA) FROM P_DEMO TRAIN MODEL DemographicsPrediction VALIDATE MODEL DemographicsPrediction FROM P_DEMO SELECT * FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.ML_VALIDATION_METRICS;\"\n\nto instantly create train and validate an ML model that you can perform predictive analysis on with integratedML's \"PREDICT\" command. It's THAT simple!\n\nResearchers and medical professionals working with big data now don't need to worry about the intricacies of SQL syntax, the obscurity of healthcare record formatting - column names and table names that do not give much information, and the need to manually dive into large datasets to find what they're looking for. With simple text prompts data processing becomes a no effort task, and predictive modelling with ML models becomes equally as effortless. See how tables come together without having to browse through large datasets with our DAG visualizations of connected tables/schemas."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our project incorporated a multitude of components that went into the development. It was both overwhelming, but also satisfying seeing so many parts come together.\n\nFrontend: The frontend was developed in Vue.js and utilized many modern day component libraries to give off a friendly UI. We also incorporated a visualization tool using third party graph libraries to draw directed acyclic graph (DAG) workflows between tables, showing the connection from one table to another that has been developed after querying the original table. To show this workflow in real time, we implemented a SQL parser API (node-sql-parser) to get a list of source tables used in the LLM generated query and used the DAGs to visually represent the list of source tables in connection to the newly modified/created table.\n\nBackend: We used Flask for the backend of our web service, handling multiple API endpoints from our data sources and LLM/prompt engineering functionality.\n\nIntersystems: We connected an IRIS intersystems database to our application and loaded it with a load of healthcare data leveraging intersystems libraries for connectors with Python.\n\nLLMs: We originally started looking into OpenAI's codex models and their integration, but ultimately worked with GPT-3.5 turbo which made it easy to fine-tune our data (to a certain degree) so our LLM could detect prompts and generate syntactically accurate queries with a high degree of accuracy. We wrapped the LLM and preprocessing of prompt engineering features as an API endpoint to integrate with our backend."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"LLMs are not as magical as they look. There was nothing for us to train the kind of datasets that are used in healthcare. We had to manually push entire database schemas for our LLM to recognize and to attempt to fine-tune on in order to get queries that were accurate. This was intensive manual labour and a lot of frustrating failures with trying to fine-tune on both current and legacy LLM models provided by OpenAI. Ultimately we came to a promising result that delivered a solid degree of accuracy with some fine-tuning. Integrating everything together - putting together countless API endpoints (honestly felt like writing production code at a certain point), hosting to our frontend, wrapping the LLM as an API endpoint. Ultimately there's definitely pain points that still need to be addressed, and we plan to make this a long term project that will help us identify bottlenecks that we didn't have time to address within these 24 hours, while simultaneously expanding on our application."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We were all aware of how much we aimed to get done in a mere span of 24 hours. It seemed near impossible. But we were all on a mission, and had the drive to bring a whole new experience to data analytics and processing to the healthcare industry by leveraging the incredible power of generative AI. The satisfaction of seeing our LLM work, trying to fine-tune manually configured data hundreds of lines long and having it accurately give us queries for IRIS including integratedML queries, the frontend come to life, the countless API endpoints work and the integration of all our services for an application with high levels of functionality.
