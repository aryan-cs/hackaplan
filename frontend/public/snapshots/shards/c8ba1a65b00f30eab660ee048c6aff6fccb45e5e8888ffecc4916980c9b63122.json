Designing an AI model that can make sense of diverse and sometimes conflicting data to offer accurate health insights. Simplifying the user experience to make it accessible to individuals without technical backgrounds. Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nSuccessful integration of multiple data streams while upholding strict privacy standards. Enabling real-time health insights through an intuitive chat interface. Positive feedback from early users who found \"aGP Chat\" beneficial in understanding their health data. What we learned\n\nThe immense potential of conversational AI in the health sector. The importance of data security and user trust in health-related applications. Challenges and solutions related to parsing and understanding complex health data. What's next for aGP Chat\n\nWe aim to expand our data integration capabilities, incorporating even more health data sources. Additionally, partnerships with healthcare professionals are on the horizon to further validate and enhance our AI's predictive capabilities. Our ultimate goal is to become the go-to platform for personalized health insights and proactive care."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"claude-2 gpt-3-turbo haystack nextjs python"}]},{"project_title":"Promptly","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/promptly-6c37ym","tagline":"Learn to prompt Claude through games.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/654/898/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Anthropic London Hackathon","hackathon_url":"https://anthropiclondon.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Third Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"claude","url":null},{"name":"nextjs","url":null},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"vercel","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"promptly-zeta.vercel.app","url":"https://promptly-zeta.vercel.app/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Prompting is something new and likely going to be very important, so it seems useful to have tools to teach people how to do it more effectively.

It was challenging to make it hard enough that you are learning to prompt effectively, the first version we had too much context in the prompt. We had to carefully remove excess context.\n\nLearning to effectively prompt with anthropic.\n\nWe had to provide helpful nudges for users so that when it is challenging they can make progress and improve their prompting. This used a second Claude API integration that integrates a chatbot.\n\nWhat we built is just with one function, which is very limiting for any kind of substantial software you'd need to have multiple functions chained together."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"claude nextjs react vercel"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"promptly-zeta.vercel.app"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:04:10.407332Z"}}
