However, more individuals are anxious to publicly articulate their ideas, whether this be through a presentation for a class, a technical workshop, or preparing for their next interview. It is often difficult for audience members to catch the true intent of the presenter, hence key factors including tone of voice, verbal excitement and engagement, and physical body language can make or break the presentation.\n\nA few weeks ago during our first project meeting, we were responsible for leading the meeting and were overwhelmed with anxiety. Despite knowing the content of the presentation and having done projects for a while, we understood the impact that a single below-par presentation could have. To the audience, you may look unprepared and unprofessional, despite knowing the material and simply being nervous. Regardless of their intentions, this can create a bad taste in the audience's mouths.\n\nAs a result, we wanted to create a judgment-free platform to help presenters understand how an audience might perceive their presentation. By creating Speech Master, we provide an opportunity for presenters to practice without facing a real audience while receiving real-time feedback."},{"heading":"Purpose","content":"Speech Master aims to provide a practice platform for practice presentations with real-time feedback that captures details in regard to your body language and verbal expressions. In addition, presenters can invite real audience members to practice where the audience member will be able to provide real-time feedback that the presenter can use to improve.\n\nWhile presenting, presentations will be recorded and saved for later reference for them to go back and see various feedback from the ML models as well as live audiences. They are presented with a user-friendly dashboard to cleanly organize their presentations and review for upcoming events.\n\nAfter each practice presentation, the data is aggregated during the recording and process to generate a final report. The final report includes the most common emotions expressed verbally as well as times when the presenter's physical body language could be improved. The timestamps are also saved to show the presenter when the alerts rose and what might have caused such alerts in the first place with the video playback."},{"heading":"Tech Stack","content":"We built the web application using Next.js v14 , a React-based framework that seamlessly integrates backend and frontend development. We deployed the application on Vercel , the parent company behind Next.js. We designed the website using Figma and later styled it with TailwindCSS to streamline the styling allowing developers to put styling directly into the markup without the need for extra files. To maintain code formatting and linting via Prettier and EsLint . These tools were run on every commit by pre-commit hooks configured by Husky .\n\nHume AI provides the Speech Prosody model with a streaming API enabled through native WebSockets allowing us to provide emotional analysis in near real-time to a presenter. The analysis would aid the presenter in depicting the various emotions with regard to tune, rhythm, and timbre.\n\nGoogle and Tensorflow provide the MoveNet model is a large improvement over the prior PoseNet model which allows for real-time pose detection. MoveNet is an ultra-fast and accurate model capable of depicting 17 body points and getting 30+ FPS on modern devices.\n\nTo handle authentication, we used Next Auth to sign in with Google hooked up to a Prisma Adapter to interface with CockroachDB , allowing us to maintain user sessions across the web app. Cloudinary , an image and video management system, was used to store and retrieve videos. Socket.io was used to interface with Websockets to enable the messaging feature to allow audience members to provide feedback to the presenter while simultaneously streaming video and audio. We utilized various services within Git and Github to host our source code, run continuous integration via Github Actions , make pull requests , and keep track of issues and projects ."},{"heading":"Challenges","content":"It was our first time working with Hume AI and a streaming API. We had experience with traditional REST APIs which are used for the Hume AI batch API calls, but the streaming API was more advantageous to provide real-time analysis. Instead of an HTTP client such as Axios, it required creating our own WebSockets client and calling the API endpoint from there. It was also a hurdle to capture and save the correct audio format to be able to call the API while also syncing audio with the webcam input.\n\nWe also worked with Tensorflow for the first time, an end-to-end machine learning platform. As a result, we faced many hurdles when trying to set up Tensorflow and get it running in a React environment. Most of the documentation uses Python SDKs or vanilla HTML/CSS/JS which were not possible for us. Attempting to convert the vanilla JS to React proved to be more difficult due to the complexities of execution orders and React's useEffect and useState hooks. Eventually, a working solution was found, however, it can still be improved to better its performance and bring fewer bugs.\n\nWe originally wanted to use the Youtube API for video management where users would be able to post and retrieve videos from their personal accounts. Next Auth and YouTube did not originally agree in terms of available scopes and permissions, but once resolved, more issues arose. We were unable to find documentation regarding a Node.js SDK and eventually even reached our quota. As a result, we decided to drop YouTube as it did not provide a feasible solution and found Cloudinary."},{"heading":"Accomplishments","content":"We are proud of being able to incorporate Machine Learning into our applications for a meaningful purpose. We did not want to reinvent the wheel by creating our own models but rather use the existing and incredibly powerful models to create new solutions. Although we did not hit all the milestones that were hoping to achieve, we are still proud of the application that we were able to make in such a short amount of time and be able to deploy the project as well.\n\nMost notably, we are proud of our Hume AI and Tensorflow integrations that took our application to the next level. Those 2 features took the most time, but they were also the most rewarding as in the end, we got to see real-time updates of our emotional and physical states. We are proud of being able to run the application and get feedback in real-time, which gives small cues to the presenter on what to improve without risking distracting the presenter completely."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Each of the developers learned something valuable as each of us worked with a new technology that we did not know previously. Notably, Prisma and its integration with CockroachDB and its ability to make sessions and general usage simple and user-friendly. Interfacing with CockroachDB barely had problems and was a powerful tool to work with.\n\nWe also expanded our knowledge with WebSockets, both native and Socket.io. Our prior experience was more rudimentary, but building upon that knowledge showed us new powers that WebSockets have both when used internally with the application and with external APIs and how they can introduce real-time analysis."},{"heading":"Future of Speech Master","content":"The first step for Speech Master will be to shrink the codebase. Currently, there is tons of potential for components to be created and reused. Structuring the code to be more strict and robust will ensure that when adding new features the codebase will be readable, deployable, and functional. The next priority will be responsiveness, due to the lack of time many components appear strangely on different devices throwing off the UI and potentially making the application unusable.\n\nOnce the current codebase is restructured, then we would be able to focus on optimization primarily on the machine learning models and audio/visual. Currently, there are multiple instances of audio and visual that are being used to show webcam footage, stream footage to other viewers, and sent to HumeAI for analysis. By reducing the number of streams, we should expect to see significant performance improvements with which we can upgrade our audio/visual streaming to use something more appropriate and robust.\n\nIn terms of new features, Speech Master would benefit greatly from additional forms of audio analysis such as speed and volume. Different presentations and environments require different talking speeds and volumes of speech required. Given some initial parameters, Speech Master should hopefully be able to reflect on those measures. In addition, having transcriptions that can be analyzed for vocabulary and speech, ensuring that appropriate language is used for a given target audience would drastically improve the way a presenter could prepare for a presentation."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cloudinary cockroachdb eslint git github humeai husky javascript next.js nextauth prettier prisma socket.io tailwindcss tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com www.figma.com speechmaster.vercel.app"}]},{"project_title":"Auto-Teach","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/auto-teach","tagline":"Teaching everywhere at anytime.

All of our team members know a relative or loved one that has endured or lost their life due to cancer. This makes us incredibly passionate about wanting to improve cancer patient care. We identi fied a common thread of roadblocks that our loved ones went through during their journey through their diagnosis/treatment/etc:\n\nDiagnosis and Staging: Properly diagnosing the type and stage of cancer is essential for determining the most appropriate treatment plan. Treatment Options: There are many different types of cancer, and treatment options can vary widely. Selecting the most effective and appropriate treatment for an individual patient can be challenging. Multidisciplinary Care: Coordinating care among various healthcare professionals, including oncologists, surgeons, radiologists, nurses, and others, can be complex but is necessary for comprehensive cancer care. Communication: Effective communication among patients, their families, and healthcare providers is crucial for making informed decisions and ensuring the patient's needs and preferences are met."},{"heading":"📖 - What it does","content":"We built Cancer360° to create a novel, multimodal approach towards detecting and predicting lung cancer. We synthesized four modes of data qualitative (think demographics, patient history), image (of lung CT scans), text (collected by an interactive chatbot), and physicical (via the ZeppOS Smartwatch) with deep learning frameworks and large language models to copmute a holistic metric for patient likelihood of lung cancer. Through this data-driven approach, we aim to address what we view as \"The BFSR\": The 'Big Four' of Surmountable Roadblocks:\n\nDiagnosis: Our diagnosis system is truly multimodal through our 4 modes: quantitative (uses risk factors, family history, demographics), qualitative (analysis of medical records like CT Scans), physical measurements (through our Zepp OS App), and our AI Nurse. Treatment Options: Our nurse can suggest multiple roadmaps of treatment options that patients could consider. For accessibility and ease of understanding, we created an equivalent to Google's featured snippets when our nurse mentions treatment options or types of treatment. Multidisciplinary Care: The way Cancer360° has been built is to be a digital aid that bridges the gaps with the automated and manual aspects of cancer treatment. Our system prompts patients to enter relevant information for our nurse to analyze and distribute what's important to healthcare professionals. Communication: This is a major need for patients and families in the road to recovery. Cancer360's AI nurse accomplishes this through our emotionally-sensitive responses and clear/instant communication with patients that input their information, vitals, and symptoms."},{"heading":"🔧 - How we built it","content":"To build our Quantitative Mode, we used the following:\n\nnumpy : for general math and numpy.array Pandas : for data processing, storage SKLearn : for machine learning (train_test_split, classification_report) XGBoost : Extreme Boosting Trees Decision Trees\n\nTo build our Qualitative Mode, we used the following:\n\nOpenCV and PIL (Python Imaging Library): For Working With Image Data MatPlotLib and Seaborn : For Scientific Plotting Keras : Image Data Augmentation (think rotating and zooming in), Model Optimizations (Reduce Learning Rate On Plateau) Tensorflow : For the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)\n\nTo build our AI Nurse, we used the following:\n\nTogether.ai: We built our chatbot with the Llama2 LLM API and used tree of thought prompt engineering to optimize our query responses\n\nTo build the portal, we used the following:\n\nReflex: We utilized the Reflex platform to build our entire frontend and backend, along with all interactive elements. We utilized front end components such as forms, buttons, progress bars, and more. More importantly, Reflex enabled us to directly integrate python-native applications like machine learning models from our quantitative and qualitative modes or our AI Nurse directly into the backend."},{"heading":"📒 - The Efficacy of our Models","content":"With Quantitative/Tabular Data:\n\nWe collected quantitative data for patient demographic, risk factors, and history (in the form of text, numbers, and binary (boolean values)). We used a simple keyword search algorithm to identify risk keywords like “Smoking” and “Wheezing” to transform the text into quantitative data. Then we aggregated all data into a single Pandas dataframe and applied one-hot-encoding on categorical variables like gender. We then used SKLearn to create a 80-20 test split, and tested various models via the SKLearn library, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and K Nearest Neighbors. We found that ultimately, XGBoost performed best with the highest 98.39% accuracy within a reasonable 16-hour timeframe. Our training dataset was used in a research paper and can be accessed here. This high accuracy speaks to the reliability of our model. However, it's essential to remain vigilant against overfitting and conduct thorough validation to ensure its generalizability, a testament to our commitment to both performance and robustness.\n\nView our classification report here\n\nWith Image Data: Our solution is well-equipped to handle complex medical imaging tasks. Using data from the Iraq-Oncology Teaching Hospital/National Center for Cancer Diseases (IQ-OTH/NCCD) lung cancer dataset, and deep learning frameworks from tensorflow and keras, we were able to build a convolution neural network to classify patient CT scans as malignant or benign. Our convolutional neural network was fine-tuned for binary image classification of 512x512 RGB images, with multiple convolutional, max-pooling, normalization, and dense layers, compiled using the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss. We also used OpenCV, PIL, Matplotlib, and Numpy to deliver a commendable 93% accuracy over a 20-hour timeframe. The utilization of dedicated hardware resources, such as Intel developer cloud with TensorFlow GPU, accelerates processing by 24 times compared to standard hardware. While this signifies our technological edge, it's important to acknowledge that image classification accuracy can vary based on data quality and diversity, making the 93% accuracy an achievement that underscores our commitment to delivering high-quality results.\n\nMalignant CT Scan\n\nBenign CT Scan\n\nAI Nurse: The AI Nurse powered by Together.ai and LLMs (such as Llama2) introduces an innovative approach to patient interaction and risk factor determination. Generating \"trees of thoughts\" showcases our ability to harness large language models for effective communication. Combining multiple AI models to determine risk factor percentages for lung cancer demonstrates our holistic approach to healthcare support. However, it's essential to acknowledge that the efficacy of this solution is contingent on the quality of language understanding, data processing, and the integration of AI models, reflecting our dedication to continuous improvement and fine-tuning."},{"heading":"🚩 - Challenges we ran into","content":"Challenges we fixed: Loading our neural network model into the Reflex backend.

Frontend: We relied on Reflex components to render everything visible on our website, encompassing graphics, buttons, forms, and more. Backend: Reflex states played a crucial role in our project by facilitating data storage and manipulation across our components. In this backend implementation, we seamlessly integrated our website features, including the chatbot, machine learning model, Zepp integration, and X-ray scan model.\n\nTogether AI\n\nIn our project, Together AI played a pivotal role in enhancing various aspects:\n\nCloud Service: We harnessed the robust capabilities of Together AI's cloud services to host, run, and fine-tune llama 2, a Large Language Model developed by META, featuring an impressive 70 billion parameters. To ensure seamless testing, we evaluated more than ten different chat and language models from various companies. This was made possible thanks to Together AI's commitment to hosting over 30 models on a single platform. Integration: We seamlessly integrated Together AI's feature set into our web app, combined with Reflex, to deliver a cohesive user experience. Tuning: Leveraging Together AI's user-friendly hyperparameter control and prompt engineering, we optimized our AI nurse model for peak performance. As a result, our AI nurse consistently generated the desired outputs at an accelerated rate, surpassing default performance levels, all without the need for extensive tuning or prompt engineering.\n\nIntel Developer Cloud\n\nOur project would not have been possible without the massive computing power of Intel cloud computers. For reference, here is the CNN training time on my local computer.\n\nAnd here is the CNN training time on my Intel® Xeon 4th Gen ® Scalable processor virtual compute environment and tensorflow GPU.\n\nA remarkable 20x Speedup! This huge leap in compute speed empowered by Intel® cloud computing enabled us to re-train our models with lightning speed as we worked to debugg and worked to integrate it into our backend. It also made fine-tuning our model much easier as we can tweak the hyperparameters and see their effects on model performance within the span of minutes.\n\nZepp Health\n\nWe utilized the ZeppOS API to query real-time user data for calories burned, fat burned, blood oxygen, and PAI (Personal Activity Index). We worked set up a PyV8 virtual javascript environment to run javascript code within Python to integrate the ZeppOS API into our application. Using collected data from the API, we used an ensemble algorithm to compute a health metric evaluating patient health, which ultimately feeds into our algorithm to find patient risk for lung cancer.\n\nGitHub\n\nWe used GitHub for our project by creating a GitHub repository to host our hackathon project's code. We also ensured that our use of GitHub stood out with a detailed ReadMe page, meaningful pull requests, and a collaboration history, showcasing our dedication to improving cancer patient care through Cancer360°. We leveraged GitHub not only for code hosting but also as a platform to collaborate, push code, and receive feedback.\n\n.Tech Domains\n\nWe harnessed the potential of a .tech domain to visually embody our vision for Cancer360°, taking a step beyond traditional domains. By registering the website helpingcancerpatientswith.tech, we not only conveyed our commitment to innovative technology but also made a memorable online statement that reflects our dedication to improving the lives of cancer patients."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"intel-developer-cloud python reflex together zeppos"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com helpingcancerpatientswith.tech"}]},{"project_title":"WorldDex","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/worlddex-6diekg","tagline":"WorldDex is a real-life Pokédex: on our mobile app, you can scan and capture any object, talk to your collection, and share your experiences (using Computer Vision, LLMs, Web3, and more)!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/641/556/datas/medium.jpeg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 10.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-10.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[MLH - Hedera] Best Blockchain Project Using Hedera"},{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 10.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-10.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Web3 Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"amazon-web-services","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services"},{"name":"cockroachdb","url":null},{"name":"elevenlabs","url":null},{"name":"ethereum","url":null},{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"gpt3.5","url":null},{"name":"gpt4","url":null},{"name":"hedera","url":null},{"name":"ios","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios"},{"name":"ipfs","url":null},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"llm","url":null},{"name":"nft","url":null},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"},{"name":"reflex","url":null},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"web3.storage","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/antqin/WorldDex"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As we go about our lives, all of us experience so much, witness so much, learn so much.

Coming soon to the web version: detailed analytics, rarities, trading, and more!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The workhorse of our mobile application is written in Swift, with iOS native speech-to-text translation and tons of custom styling and design. The app interacts with a variety of powerful back-ends:\n\nOBJECT DETECTION, CAPTURE, AND PROBABILITY are handled by an AWS EC2 instance with a Deep Learning AMI running PyTorch 2.0 with an NVIDIA T4 GPU. The instance runs inference on a state-of-the-art pre-trained zero-shot object detection model called GroundingDINO (Liu et al., 2023).\n\nAssociated technology: GroundingDINO, AWS EC2, PyTorch, iOS speech-to-text, GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct, GPT 4\n\nA flask server runs on the EC2 instance. When the user takes a scan and speaks into their phone, iOS speech-to-text transcribes the user's message and sends both the image and the user's provided information to the back-end. We use GPT-3.5 Turbo Instruct (instruct-tuned version of GPT exceptionally good at executing novel, precise instructions) to extract the object label within the user's spoken text. With some careful prompt engineering and in-context learning, the label extraction works like a charm even when given complex and long audio transcriptions. GroundingDINO is a pre-trained transformer-based object detection model that can predict on any natural language label (rather than only on labels it was trained on), which enables WorldDex users to collect anything they can dream of! GroundingDINO uses the label spoken by the user as a prompt to search for all instances of their desired object in the photo taken on their phone. It assigns these instances with a confidence score, and the instance with the max confidence score (logits) is bounded and scanned. In WorldDex, the success of a catch is a function of this confidence score. This bounding box is later used in the mobile app to crop a perfect thumbnail image for the object.\n\nDATA STORAGE AND BLOCKCHAIN INTERACTIONS are handled by an intricate JavaScript microservice architecture. This back-end uses Node.js and Express to route across a variety of on and off-chain services.\n\nAssociated Technology: Hedera, CockroachDB, Express, web3.storage, Ethereum, IPFS\n\nDatabase information (user account info, friends, image metadata, images, etc) are stored in a server-less CockroachDB instance. Through our endpoints, the back-end writes SQL queries to properly interact with the DB. When a catch is confirmed, the back-end uses the web3.storage framework to deploy the image onto IPFS for decentralized storage. Although a copy is maintained in our internal database for quick access, this grants the user the ability to share and interact with their image external to our centralized application. After a catch has been hosted by IPFS, our custom WLDD Token programmatically deployed on the open-source PoS Hedera network's testnet is used to mint an original NFT based on the image. This NFT contains in on-chain metadata a pointer to the IPFS metadataCID. The Hedera network offers straightforward and highly cost-effective functionality. Once the image has been stored on IPFS and an associated NFT has been minted, the unique ID we generate per image is granted to the user's collection on our custom Ethereum smart contract deployed on the Sepolia Testnet. Why the need for interactions with Ethereum AND Hedera? Our Ethereum smart contract allows for our own two-party trading functionality. However, we plan to deploy this EVM byte code to the Hedera network to simplify in the future.\n\nCHATTING WITH COLLECTION is handled by another API hosted on the same GPU-accelerated EC2 instance used by the models. When the user records an audio message in the mobile app, we use iOS speech to text to transcribe the message and send it to this API. The API uses GPT-4 to determine the response, with additional context retrieved from the database's image labels and metadata. Then, it uses the state-of-the-art text-to-speech model from ElevenLabs (with streaming functionality for minimized latency) to read out the model's response and hold a conversation with the user.\n\nAssociated Technology: GPT-4, ElevenLabs TTS, AWS EC2\n\nCOMMUNITY & PROFILE is built on the frontend using Swift and portrays your community's captures in real time. You can see people's captured items, their capture location, time of capture, probability of capture, and live audio transcription notes. Each user's captures are linked to their unique accounts, for which they can sign up for an account or log in on the profile page of the app. The frontend is linked to the CockroachDB database, making GET and POST requests to display community posts and manage creation of profiles.\n\nAssociated Technology: Swift, XCode, CockroachDB\n\nTHE WEB APPLICATION is built with Reflex and backed by the same JavaScript API and databases as the other front-end. Here, we display a more dynamic interface meant to be more nostalgic of opening the PokeDex upon logging in to your account. However, we also wanted to include a web app to give us flexibility for future extensions, with the ability to display detailed visualizations, analytics, trade, and more.\n\nAssociated Technology: Reflex\n\nWe know that's a lot of text and a lot of technologies. So:"},{"heading":"The TLDR is:","content":"Your image and label are sent to a Python back-end, which use a combination of models to determine if you actually correctly identified what you scanned. If you did (and get a bit lucky), your catch completes. At this point, we store a copy in a centralized CockroachDB server less database. We also store your image in a decentralized manner on IPFS, mint you an NFT on Hedera associated with the IPFS metadata, and register your ownership on Ethereum in case you want to start trading. The user can chat with an item from their collection. Their audio message is transcribed and sent to a back-end, which asks GPT-4 for a prompted response and plays this back with ElevenLabs Text-to-Speech for the user. Users can share their captures and see other's captures in the community page. Each user has a unique password-protected account with their captures that they can create/login to on the account page. There's also a Reflex web application, from which you can check out your collection upon logging in. In the future, it offers a great home for more complex analytics and displays.\n\nDOUBLE TAP!\n\nCheck out our Sepolia Ethereum Smart Contract (code in the GitHub Repo) governing trading. Check out what's being minted on our custom Hedera WLDD Token . Check out one of our favorite IPFS hosted images , which was recently collected and minted!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"HIGH LATENCY Our APIs are highly complex and interact with a variety of frameworks. This introduces latency and robustness issues. Specifically, on a successful catch, we have to:\n\nPerform speech-to-text with iOS built-in functionality Analyze text using fine-tuned GPT 3.5 Identify instances of an object type using GroundingDINO and rank them by probability, selecting the highest probability one and determining if a catch will happen Writing caught image and associated metadata to CockroachDB Deploying caught image to IPFS Minting NFT including IPFS metadata CID on Hedera Transferring NFT from treasury to user Logging catch onto Ethereum smart contract\n\nTo solve this problem, we divided this functionality into two portions: low-latency required and high-latency allowed. The user needs to know if they caught their object, which requires steps 1-3 to happen rapidly. To adjust, we used built-in iOS speech-to-text instead of a more general-purpose transcription model like the one offered by AssemblyAI (we tested it, but latency was too high). We used a fine-tuned version of GPT 3.5 Turbo Instruct, which is geared towards novel instruction types to reduce the performance tradeoff you get from avoiding the cost and time required by GPT-4. We also hosted on an AWS EC2 instance using a T4 GPU to speed up GroundingDINO computation.\n\nOnce the user has caught their item, we display a cached version of the image, allowing our back-end time to handle the higher-latency blockchain and database interactions.\n\nEXPLODING COMPLEXITY Our three back-ends threatened to create an exploding complexity problem which would have made debugging impossible. However, by siloing endpoints and routing related calls to more abstracted sections handling functionality, we were able to develop iteratively and minimize failure. We have:\n\nA set of independent endpoints handling Ethereum smart contract interactions A set of independent functions handling IPFS deployment A set of independent functions handling Hedera minting and transfer A set of endpoints wrapping IPFS deployment, Hedera interactions, and Ethereum calls into a single abstraction. A set of endpoints wrapping serverless CockroachDB functionality and caching.\n\nWe used a similar approach to carefully create an effective back-end for our AWS EC2 instance.\n\nINTUITIVE UI Building simple, intuitive UI for a social app with so much functionality and unique technologies was a big challenge. From figuring out the best flow of user experience to adding the smallest things that provided users with more information about what's happening behind the scenes (e.g. loading v.s. empty screen, flashing dot for speaking AI), we invested a lot of time in optimizing the human-computer interaction (HCI) and designing a novel and forward-looking interface that leverages large language models (LLMs)."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we are proud of","content":"User Interface and Design We had a vision for our application—to interweave the joy of exploration with the extraordinary nature of everyday life. Although our mobile app, back-ends, and models are far from perfect, we are incredibly excited at just how fun it is for the four of us to scan random objects, talk to our collection, and share what we have discovered.\n\nIntegration of New Technologies We rapidly prototyped and iterated over a wide variety of new technologies. We knew just how extensible a real-life PokeDex could be; there were infinite directions to take! Using the sponsor list and our own field knowledge as inspiration, we tested out different APIs, frameworks, and models until we found the combination that matched our vision. Although this means we took an uncommon and often complex approach to our project, it has also resulted in some very cool functionality.\n\nPurposeful Incorporation of AI and Crypto We find using the blockchain or artificial intelligence simply because they exist to be a silly approach. Instead, as we read about different new technologies, we asked ourselves how their design aligns with our vision for WorldDex. We used a variety of state-of-the-art models for a plethora of functions, but nothing is casual; difference instances of GPT help to contextualize or explain, object-detection models... detect objects, text-to-speech models bring alive the PokeDex we remember from watching Cartoon Network as kids.\n\nMeanwhile, decentralization lets us put the collection in the hands of the users. If we could, the model would be running on the blockchain too (trust us - we looked into some ideas related to that). While NFTs and smart contracts allow for trading, monetization, and a market economy, they more fundamentally mean that when you collect a picture, it's verifiably yours . Hedera lets us do these mints at a remarkably low cost."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"It is hard to describe how much we learned in such a short period of time! We are frankly shocked at how many different technologies and functionalities we were able to weave into the same project in less than two days.\n\nIntuitive UI, UX, and HCI We experimented a lot on our UI through user testing and feedback, especially in the more novel aspects of the app (e.g. LLM and voice integration). We learned about the value of simplicity but also the value of information, finding a balance between keeping the experience enjoyable and intuitive while providing the user with all the information they needed to fully leverage the app.\n\nModel Comparison Shopping We learned a ton about different state-of-the-art models and their relative tradeoffs. We had to select the best models to our latency, accuracy, cost, and storage requirements. While we all know a lot about machine learning and artificial intelligence in the academic environment, watching the impact of different real-world models on these crucial in-production outcomes was fascinating.\n\nCrypto and Blockchain Integrations It is becoming increasingly clear that while adoption of crypto nosedives, technology and infrastructure for the field is exploding. We are ridiculously excited at how efficiently new crypto protocols and chains are offering high levels of programmability at low costs without sacrificing core blockchain principles. While we might still be most comfortable in Solidity, the once-painful smart contract programming process has gotten so much easier.\n\nDatabases and Back-end Integrations It is remarkable how easy it is to get up and running on a database like CockroachDB, with direct SQL queries after minimal setup. High-performance back-ends interacting with a variety of different APIs and data storage solutions are increasingly viable every day. It was so much fun to construct one (or a couple) and watch them work in real-time.\n\nAnd finally, a lot of what we learned and are excited about happens in what we did not use. In the future, we want to spend more time exploring vector databases for RAG, increased privacy chains and crypto-native languages, and more when extending this project and others."},{"heading":"What's next for WorldDex","content":"We want to expand on the community. We imagine planned events in which scavenger hunts and collection events ask users to capture a certain subset of items in a set period or within a set geographical location. Imagine: collect the SF 100 Set of Items in 24 hours to win a prize! We want to build out the social side of the application. Being able to interact with other users, trade more robustly, and create a more open marketplace will allow for tons of fun and has cool implications for rarity and more. We want to improve the educational features. While being able to talk with an object is a feature we are really happy about, augmenting GPT's ability to explain facts about an item with a vector database would supercharge our app's ability to teach."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"amazon-web-services cockroachdb elevenlabs ethereum express.js gpt3.5 gpt4 hedera ios ipfs javascript llm nft pytorch reflex swift web3.storage"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"MindScape: Neural Odyssey","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/eeg-placeholder","tagline":"Because peace of mind is not a destination, it's a journey.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/644/463/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 10.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-10.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Intel Developer Cloud"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"cockroachdb","url":null},{"name":"eeg","url":null},{"name":"hume","url":null},{"name":"intel-developer-cloud","url":null},{"name":"pandas","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"reflex","url":null},{"name":"scipy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scipy"},{"name":"ssh","url":null},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null},{"name":"together-ai","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/assasin2gamer/CalHacks"},{"label":"docs.google.com","url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17ahTTy1EFVmGAcDsX3hUma_ammdUM_Q84VL8W7gPkeA/edit#slide=id.p"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/mishcoder/calhacks"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Our project draws inspiration from the challenge of classifying emotions, a complex task.

The designers brought to life a theme of nature into the application, symbolizing each story as a leaf, a life's collective memories as trees, and cultural groves of forests. The frontend squad meticulously sculpted an immersive onboarding journey, integrating seamless interactions with the backend, and spotlighting the TTS and STT features.

Luckily, one of our teammates had some experience with processing GeoSpatial data so drafting coordinates on a map wasn’t our biggest hurdle to overcome. Another challenge we faced were certain edge cases in our initial Django backend that resulted in invalid data. Since some outputs would be relevant to our project, we had to make an executive decision to change backend midway through. We decided to go with FastApi. Although FastApi brought its own challenge with processing SQL to usable data, it was our way of overcoming our Jango situation. One last challenge we ran into was our overall source control.

Over the years, this community has been expanding, as the idea of drinking a coffee or energetic drink becomes a trending activity, fostering new types of beverages in the market and coffee shops. While caffeine benefits one's performance, people tend to overestimate the advantages and neglect caffeine's side effects. If you consumes in the wrong amount or at the wrong time, caffeine can take the entire productivity thing against you: you will feel more fatigue, headaches, excessive anxiety, or harm sleep quality. The team's members and many others have experienced the side effects, without exactly knowing the underlying cause and feeling even more frustrated because they assumed that caffeine would enhance their performance. Therefore, the team created the Caffeine Intake Advisor to prevent people from consuming caffeine in an ineffective and potentially unhealthy way. Zepp's Smart watch also contributes to the ideation process. The advisor relies on a person's biological data to recommend accurate caffeine amounts, thus facilitating the user's life.

These variables will be measured through Step 2 below."},{"heading":"How the user’s data will be collected and used:","content":"1. (First, the app will give an initial questionnaire when the person creates the account) The questionnaire mainly aims to gather this information:\n\nServing size: Amount of caffeinated drinks that the person drinks per day ( as well as the amount of caffeinated food) Time : The usual time period that the person is used to intake Variability : Does the person consume the same serving size every day? Or they drink more at specific times of the day Duration of habit: for how long does the person have this habit.\n\n2.After, the app will begin to measure, for 5 days, the coffee sensitivity based on these real-time data:\n\nSleeping pattern: sleep time and wake-up time Here is how the machine will track the sleeping pattern in these 5 days I* dentify the sleeping pattern baseline: * the usual sleep time and wake up time before the 5-days observation period. This can be extracted from the questionnaire above Identify the effects on sleeping pattern based on intake variation: During the monitoring week, the person can consume different amounts of caffeine and vary the timing of caffeine intake on different days. For example, they might have a standard amount of caffeine (their usual) on some days and a reduced or increased amount on other days. They can also adjust the time of caffeine consumption, such as having caffeine earlier or later in the day. Record the sleep-related data at regular intervals throughout the monitoring week.\n\nAfter getting these data, the machine should :\n\nCompare sleep patterns on days with standard caffeine intake to days with reduced or increased caffeine intake. Regular Timing and sleep pattern: Compare sleep patterns on days with standard caffeine intake to days with hours before the sleeping time ( this can be extracted from extracting the time of the day the person consume caffeine)\n\nStress level and Heart rate Here is how the machine will track the stress and heart rate in these 5 days Identify the person’s stress level and heart’s rate baseline***: starts recording stress levels and heart rate from the moment the individual wakes up in the morning, before consuming any caffeine. Measure the caffeine direct impact on the person :*** measure the stress and hear rate immediately after the person consumes their first dose of caffeine for the day.\n\n3. After knowing the user’s Regular Caffeine Intake after 5 days. The watch can now recommend the caffeine intake every time the user wants to consume. To do that, the machine needs to calculate the x amount of caffeine per y hours of focus without yielding negative effects. To do that the machine will use this formula\n\nCaffeine Amount (mg) = Regular Caffeine Intake x Caffeine Sensitivity Factor x Study Duration x Time Gap Factor\n\nEXAMPLE:\n\n**Hypothetical Values:** - Regular Caffeine Intake: 200 mg (the individual's typical daily caffeine consumption) - Caffeine Sensitivity Factor: 0.5 (a multiplier representing the individual's moderate caffeine sensitivity) - Study Goal: Stay awake and enhance focus - Study Duration: 4 hours (the intended duration of the study session) - Time of Study: 7:00 PM to 11:00 PM (4 hours before the individual's typical bedtime at 11:00 PM) - Desired Sleep Quality: The individual prefers to have high-quality sleep without disruptions. **Simplified Calculation:** Now, we'll consider the timing of caffeine consumption and its impact on sleep quality to estimate the amount of caffeine needed: 1. **Assessing Timing and Sleep Quality:** - Calculate the time gap between the end of the study session (11:00 PM) and bedtime (11:00 PM). In this case, it's zero hours, indicating the study session ends at bedtime. - Since the individual desires high-quality sleep, we aim to minimize caffeine's potential effects on sleep disruption. 2. **Caffeine Amount Calculation:** - To achieve the study goal (staying awake and enhancing focus) without impacting sleep quality, we aim to use the caffeine primarily during the study session. - We'll calculate the amount of caffeine needed during the study session to maintain focus, which is the 4-hour duration.\n\nT*ime gap factor* = hours before sleep time ( time when intaking caffeine - sleep time)"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We use intel data to train an algorithm.

We also organized a table that specifies types of caffeinated beverages and food according to the amount of caffeine based on their quantity in different units ( for example, in grams or ounces).\n\nUI/UX Design/ Product Management We first designed two types of wireframes of the smartwatch and tried which provided an easier and smoother process, so the user can get their caffeine intake recommendation as easily, convenient, and accurately as possible. After deciding on the user flow, we looked into specific features and their placements on the interfaces, brainstorming the questions:\n\nWhich feature is needed to accomplish task x Which feature is relevant ( but not necessary) to improve the user's experience during task x What is the hierarchy of the visual and textual elements that prevent cognitive load ( consider the smartwatch interface) and appeal to the user's intuitive navigation in the app\n\nTraining Algorithms We make use of MindsDB pre-train models to predict the amount of caffeine each person can have according to the goal and body's condition.

Manage your relationships in a centralized way and view LLM-generated insights regarding relationships and when might be the right time/how to rekindle them."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The entire stack we used for this project was Python, with the full stack web development being enabled by the Reflex Python package, and database being Firebase.\n\nEat Now is a feature that bases itself around geolocation, dietary preferences, financial preferences, calendar availability, and LLM recommendation systems. We take your location, go through your friends list and find the friends who are near you and don’t have immediate conflicts on their calendar, compute an intersection of possible restaurants via the Yelp API that would be within a certain radius of both of you, filter this intersection with dietary + financial preferences (vegetarian? vegan? cheap?), then pass all our user context into a LLAMA-13B-Chat 💬 to generate a final recommendation. This recommendation surfaces itself as a potential invite (in figures above) that the user can choose whether or not to send to another person. If they accept, a calendar invite is automatically generated.\n\nSchedule Ahead is a feature that bases itself around graph machine learning, calendar availability, personal relationship status (how close are y’all? When is the last time you saw each other?), dietary/financial preferences, and more. By looking ahead into the future, we take the time to look through our social network graph with associated metadata and infer relationships via Spectral Clustering 📊. Based on how long it’s been since you last hung out and the strength of your relationship, it will surface who to meet with as a priority queue and look at both calendars to determine mutually available times and locations with the same LLM.\n\nWe use retrieval augmented generation (RAG) 📝 throughout our app to power personalized friend insights (to learn more about which friends you should catch up with, learn that Jason is a foodie, and what cuisines you and Parth like). This method is also a part of our recommendation algorithm."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Dealing with APIs. We utilized a number of APIs to provide a level of granularity and practicality to this project, rather than something that’s solely a mockup. Dealing with APIs though comes with its own issues. The Yelp API, for example, continuously rate limited us even though we cycled through keys from all of our developer accounts :’). The Google Calendar API required a lot of exploration with refresh tokens, necessary scopes, managing state with google auth, etc. New Technologies. We challenged ourselves by exploring some new technologies as a part of our stack to complete this project. Graph ML for example was a technology we hadn’t worked with much before, and we quickly ran into the cold start problem with meaningless graphs and unintuitive relationships. Reflex was another new technology that we used to complete our frontend and backend entirely in Python. None of us had ever even pip installed this package before, so learning how to work with it and then turn it into something complex and useful was a fun challenge. 💡 Latency. Because our app queries several APIs, we had to make our code as performant as possible, utilize concurrency where possible, and add caching for frequently-queried endpoints. 🖥️"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The amount of complexity that we were able to introduce into this project made it mimic real-life as close as possible, which is something we’re very proud of.

Enabling the formation of groups on the app would give us more metadata information regarding the relationships between people, lending itself to improved GNN algorithms and recommendations, and improve the stickiness of the product by introducing network effects. New Intros: Extending to the Mutuals. We’ve built a wonderful graph of relationships that includes metadata not super common to a social network. Why not leverage this to generate introductions and form new relationships between people? More Integrations.

On the main page, we implemented a rich text editor from TinyMCE to serve as our text input, allong with various applicable plugins to make the user input experience as seamless as possible.\n\nOur backend is Python based. We set up API responses using FastAPI. Once the front end posts the given recipe, our backend passes the recipe ingredients and dietary restrictions into a fine-tuned large language model - specifically GPT4.\n\nOur LLM had to be fine-tuned using a combination of provided context, hyper-parameter adjustment, and prompt engineering. We modified its responses with a focus on both dietary restrictions knowledge and specific output formatting.\n\nThe prompt engineering concepts we employed to receive the most optimal outputs were n-shot prompting, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting, and generated knowledge prompting."},{"heading":"UI/UX","content":"User Personas\n\nWe build some user personas to help us better understand what needs our application could fulfil\n\nUser Flow\n\nThe user flow was made to help us determine the necessary functionality we wanted to implement to make this application useful\n\nLo-fi Prototypes\n\nThese lo-fi mockups were made to determine what layout we would present to the user to use our primary functionality\n\nHi-fi Prototypes\n\nHere we finalized the styling choice of a blue and yellow gradient, and we started planning for incorporating our extra feature as well - the recipe recomendations"},{"heading":"Engineering","content":"Frontend: React, JS, HTML, CSS, TinyMCE, Vite\n\nBackend: FastAPI, Python\n\nLLM: GPT4\n\nDatabase: Zilliz\n\nHosting: Vercel (frontend), Render (backend)"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Frontend Challenges\n\nOur recipe modification service is particularly sensitive to the format of the user-provided ingredients and dietary restrictions. This put the responsibility of vetting user input onto the frontend. We had to design multiple mechanisms to sanitize inputs before sending them to our API for further pre-processing. However, we also wanted to make sure that recipes were still readable by the humans who inputted them. Using the TinyMCE editor solved this problem effortlessly as it allowed us to display text in the format it was pasted, while simultaneously allowing our application to access a \"raw\", unformatted version of the text.\n\nTo display our modified recipe, we had to brainstorm the best ways to highlight any substitutions we made. We tried multiple different approaches including some pre-built components online. In the end, we decided to build our own custom component to render substitutions from the formatting returned by the backend.\n\nWe also had to design a user flow that would provide feedback while users wait for a response from our backend. This materialized in the form of an interim loading screen with a moving GIF indicating that our application had not timed out. This loading screen is dynamic, and automatically re-routes users to the relevant pages upon hearing back from our API.\n\nBackend Challenges\n\nThe biggest challenge we ran into was selecting a LLM that could produce consistent results based off different input recipes and prompt engineering. We started out with Together.AI, but found that it was inconsistent in formatting and generating valid allergy substitutions. After trying out other open-source LLMs, we found that they also produced undesirable results. Eventually, we compromised with GPT-4, which could produce the results we wanted after some prompt engineering; however, it it is not a free service.\n\nAnother challenge was with the database. After implementing the schema and functionality, we realized that we partitioned our design off of the incorrect data field. To finish our project on time, we had to store more values into our database in order for similarity search to still be implemented."},{"heading":"Takeaways","content":"Accomplishments that we're proud of\n\nFrom coming in with no knowledge, we were able to build a full stack web applications making use of the latest offerings in the LLM space. We experimented with prompt engineering, vector databases, similarity search, UI/UX design, and more to create a polished product. Not only are we able to demonstrate our learnings through our own devices, but we are also able to share them out with the world by deploying our application.\n\nAll that said , our proudest accomplishment was creating a service which can provide significant help to many in a common everyday experience: cooking and enjoying food with friends and family.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nFor some of us on the team, this entire project was built in technologies that were unfamiliar. Some of us had little experience with React or FastAPI so that was something the more experienced members got to teach on the job.\n\nOne of the concepts we spent the most time learning was about prompt engineering.\n\nWe also learned about the importance of branching on our repository as we had to build 3 different components to our project all at the same time on the same application.\n\nLastly, we spent a good chunk of time learning how to implement and improve our similarity search.\n\nWhat's next for Let Them Cook\n\nWe're very satisfied with the MVP we built this weekend, but we know there is far more work to be done.\n\nFirst, we would like to deploy our recipe similarity service currently working on a local environment to our production environment. We would also like to incorporate a ranking system that will allow our LLM to take in crowdsourced user feedback in generating recipe substitutions.\n\nAdditionally, we would like to enhance our recipe substitution service to make use of recipe steps rather than solely ingredients . We believe that the added context of how ingredients come together will result in even higher quality substitutions.\n\nFinally, we hope to add an option for users to directly insert a recipe URL rather than copy-and-pasting the ingredients. We would write another service to scrape the site and extract the information a user would previously paste."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ai fastapi javascript llm openai python react tinymce zilliz"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"letthemcook.tech github.com github.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Article Semantic Comprehension ","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/article-semantic-comprehension","tagline":"Articles are often misleading, this Accessibility technology determines bias in language from articles as-well as ensure summarisation","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 10.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-10.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[MLH - Taipy] Best Use of Taipy"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"hume","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"taipy","url":null},{"name":"together","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/NickCoding22/article_analysis"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"One of our project partners came up with this idea during the summer.
