While large solo performances may have people in charge of turning pages, for larger scale ensemble works this obviously proves impractical. At this hackathon, inspired by the discussion around technology and music at the keynote speech, we wanted to develop a tool that could aid musicians.\n\nSeeing AdHawks's MindLink demoed at the sponsor booths, ultimately give us a clear vision for our hack. MindLink, a deceptively ordinary looking pair of glasses, has the ability to track the user's gaze in three dimensions, recognizes events such as blinks and even has an external camera to display the user's view. Blown away by the possibility and opportunities this device offered, we set out to build a hands-free sheet music tool that simplifies working with digital sheet music."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Noteation is a powerful sheet music reader and annotator. All the musician needs to do is to upload a pdf of the piece they plan to play. Noteation then displays the first page of the music and waits for eye commands to turn to the next page, providing a simple, efficient and most importantly stress-free experience for the musician as they practice and perform. Noteation also enables users to annotate on the sheet music, just as they would on printed sheet music and there are touch controls that allow the user to select, draw, scroll and flip as they please."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Noteation is a web app built using React and Typescript. Interfacing with the MindLink hardware was done on Python using AdHawk's SDK with Flask and CockroachDB to link the frontend with the backend."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One challenge we came across was deciding how to optimally allow the user to turn page using eye gestures. We tried building regression-based models using the eye-gaze data stream to predict when to turn the page and built applications using Qt to study the effectiveness of these methods. Ultimately, we decided to turn the page using right and left wink commands as this was the most reliable technique that also preserved the musicians' autonomy, allowing them to flip back and forth as needed.\n\nStrategizing how to structure the communication between the front and backend was also a challenging problem to work on as it is important that there is low latency between receiving a command and turning the page. Our solution using Flask and CockroachDB provided us with a streamlined and efficient way to communicate the data stream as well as providing detailed logs of all events."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're so proud we managed to build a functioning tool that we, for certain, believe is super useful. As musicians this is something that we've legitimately thought would be useful in the past, and granted access to pioneering technology to make that happen was super exciting. All while working with a piece of cutting-edge hardware technology that we had zero experience in using before this weekend."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"One of the most important things we learnt this weekend were the best practices to use when collaborating on project in a time crunch. We also learnt to trust each other to deliver on our sub-tasks and helped where we could. The most exciting thing that we learnt while learning to use these cool technologies, is that the opportunities are endless in tech and the impact, limitless."},{"heading":"What's next for Noteation: Music made Intuitive","content":"Some immediate features we would like to add to Noteation is to enable users to save the pdf with their annotations and add landscape mode where the pages can be displayed two at a time. We would also really like to explore more features of MindLink and allow users to customize their control gestures. There's even possibility of expanding the feature set beyond just changing pages, especially for non-classical musicians who might have other electronic devices to potentially control. The possibilities really are endless and are super exciting to think about!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"adhawk cockroachdb flask python react typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Lucid.ai","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/lucid-ai-95nerk","tagline":"Let's turn that book into a movie.

However, the infrastructure for bikes is very behind compared to that of motor vehicles. This has lead to a high number of accidents among cyclists, who must often share the road with cars. In fact, over 130,000 cyclists are injured in road accidents every year in the US.\n\nIf we want to build better cities, we need to make our infrastructure available for everyone—bikes are a great way to incentivize lawmakers and legislators to pursue densification projects & more economically viable alternatives to typical urban sprawl."},{"heading":"⚒ What it does","content":"Tandem is a hardware extension for bicycles that aims to improve safety for cyclists in cities. We use a rear-mounted camera to track vehicles and alert riders of potentially unsafe situations via the handlebar-mounted touchscreen display. These include when vehicles are approaching quickly from behind, or if a vehicle is in the cyclist's blind spot.\n\nFurther, cyclists are able to report accidents along their route which are then tracked on a publicly-accessible map. This valuable location data can be used by cities to prioritize areas for better cycling and pedestrian infrastructure."},{"heading":"📸 How we built it","content":"The camera is a Luxonis OAK-D with an on-chip computer vision processor and two spatial cameras for depth perception. We used a modified open-source model from OpenVINO to recognize vehicles. The camera and model results are sent to the Raspberry Pi, which uses Flask and on-device machine learning to stream it to our web frontend built in Next.js hosted on Vercel.\n\nWe developed weighted algorithms based on the size and locations of the bounding boxes to offer blind spot warnings and score the overall safety of the cyclist's current environment. To communicate these warnings to cyclists, we use Flask to send real-time data over an open WebSocket connection to our dashboard. Finally, the accident location database is stored on CockroachDB and is manipulated by an Express server running on Heroku."},{"heading":"☕️ Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the greatest and most persistent challenges of the build was the slow processing speeds of the Raspberry Pi 3 board. This was exacerbated by our power source, which was a portable power bank that output slightly under 5V power. Unfortunately, because of this, the Pi behaved inconsistently and lagged for long periods of time while booting, loading the camera, and activating the browser (up to 3 minutes).\n\nAt one point, we had also strapped a portable speaker on the bike to enable sound cues based on hazards in the cyclist’s environment. However, we found that the speaker would play sounds repeatedly and would become more of a nuisance than a boon to cyclists. We ultimately ended up scrapping it.\n\nThe algorithms we used to determine blind spot presence and risk scores based on bounding boxes were also a challenge to fine tune. In the beginning, there would often be many false positives where a blind spot warning was issued but the detected vehicle was still far behind the cyclist. Or, the algorithm would report an unsafe cycling environment while there were very few vehicles on the road. By trial and error, we managed to find threshold values for these algorithms that give reasonably consistent results."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are very proud of our efficiency and cohesiveness as a team. Each member was responsible for a unique aspect of the build, ranging from hardware integration to CV processing to geolocation, and executed well. We were able to achieve 90%+ success rates of car detection, and decentralized our location & incident reporting facilities using CockroachDB—and even managed to get a few friends in Toronto to try it out using similar hardware sets!\n\nAlthough many of the technologies we used were unfamiliar, we still managed to complete the project in under 36 hours; complete with CV, location tracking/services, NLP letter generation, classification, post-incident reporting, and dozens of other features..\n\nWe also think the bike looks pretty cool."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This was the first hardware hack for every member of our team.

Surprisingly, performance was also now much more important, with the limited compute resources of the Pi. Thus, we could not afford to have large bundle sizes or unoptimized code."},{"heading":"What's next for Tandem","content":"The OAK-D camera also provides two cameras for depth perception and spatial analysis, which could be used to give distances to detected vehicles.

In other instances where skiers, hikers, or travelers get lost in the backcountry, emergency personnel have no way of communicating with those who are lost and can only rely on sweeping large areas of land in a short amount of time to be successful in rescuing those in danger.\n\nThis is where Lifeline comes in.

Additionally, each node consists of a wifi chip capable of acting as both a wifi access point as well as a wifi client. The intention of these nodes is to allow users to connect their cellular devices to the secondary nodes through the local wifi networks created by the wifi access point. They can then send emergency information to response personnel such as their location, their injuries, etc. Additionally, each secondary node contains an array of sensors that can be used both by those in danger in remote communities or by emergency personnel when they venture out into the field so members of the control center team can view their vitals. All of the data collected by the secondary nodes is then sent using the LoRa protocol to other secondary nodes in the area before finally reaching the control node where the data is processed and uploaded to a central server. Our dashboard then fetches the data from this central server and displays it in a beautiful and concise interface for the relevant personnel to read and utilize.\n\nLifeline has several main use cases:\n\nEstablishing communication in remote areas, especially after a natural disaster Search and Rescue missions Providing vitals for emergency response individuals to control center personnel when they are out in the field (such as firefighters)"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The hardware nodes used in Lifeline are all built on the ESP32 microcontroller platform along with a SX1276 LoRa module and IoT wifi module.

This is when we stumbled upon Axelar and the Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) model which was perfect for applying the Collective Intelligence Theory across different chains. Using Axelar, our decentralized mutual fund can have token assets from varying chains, whether it’s MATIC on the Polygon network, or AVAX on Avalanche. Hence… Enter a decentralized, democratic, mutual fund!"},{"heading":"🔍 What it does","content":"Just DAO It! Provides a framework for people to easily implement decentralized mutual funds. This allows for people to create their own mutual funds, without having to pay a management fee to the bank. We used smart contracts to act as mutual funds, with customers buying governance tokens with USDC. These governance tokens are both bought and sold, acting as shares to the mutual fund. This also dictates the amount of voting power they get. Every month, people can propose an investment in an asset via DAO proposals and the shareholders will decide as a group whether or not to approve or disapprove the request. The proposals are then sent via call contracts with tokens, which perform buy/sell operations on their chain. Proxy contracts swap USDC to native token to perform buy operation, or convert native token to USDC to transfer back to the DAO smart contract USDC from tokens sold is fed back into the DAO Fund Pool, to be exercised at a later point. To combat whales, we have implemented a quadratic voting system where the voting power corresponds to the transformed radical function of the governance tokens, meaning that it is near impossible to hold a share of over 50%. This allows the voting system to be truly democratic, and allows everyone to play their role in deciding how their money is invested. Finally, when a customer wishes to withdraw their money from the DAO, they do so by having their tokens burnt and the corresponding amount of USDC returned to them."},{"heading":"⚙️ Tech Stack","content":"• The UI/UX was designed with Figma\n\n• The front end was built on Next.js, the CSS was implemented with TailwindCSS, while the animations were done with framer-motion.

We incentivize users by rewarding them with cryptocurrency tokens (such as SNR ) for their time spent on ads, creating a win/win situation . Not only that, but it can send advertisers anonymous info and analytics about how successful their ads are, helping them to improve further.\n\nUpon opening the app, users are met with a clean dashboard UI displaying their current token balance, as well as transfer history. In the top right corner, there exists a dropdown menu where the user can choose from various options. This includes the opportunity to enter and update their personal information that they would like to share with advertisers (for ad personalization), an ads dashboard where they can view all relevant ads, and a permissions section for them to opt in/out of where and how their data is being shared (e.g. third parties).

With our platform, we allow users to customize many different video aspects within the platform and share it with the world.\n\nThe process for the user:\n\nUser searches for a Wikipedia article on our platform The user can start our video generation platform by specifying the length of the video that is wanted The user can specify the formality of the video depending on what the target audience is (For the classroom, for sharing information on TikTok & Instagram, etc.) The user can specify what voice model they want to use for the audio, using IBM’s text-to-speech API, the possibilities are endless The user can then specify what kind of background music they want playing in the video Once this step for the user is done, we are able to generate a short version of the Wikipedia article via co:here, create audio for the video via Watson AI, and generate keywords to use while finding GIFs, videos, and images on Pexels and Tenor, and put them in a video format."},{"heading":"How we built it ⚡️","content":"We mashed up many cutting-edge services to help bring our project to life.\n\nFirebase Storage - Store Audio files From Watson in the Cloud ☁️ Watson Text-to-Speech - Generate audio for the video 🎵 Wikipedia API - Get all the information from Wikipedia ℹ️ co:here Generate API - Generate summaries for Wikipedia articles.

Our goal was to summarise whole Wikipedia articles, which often contain far more than 2048 words. To get around this, we developed complex algorithms to summarize sections of articles, then summarize groups of summaries, and so on.\n\nIt was difficult to preserve accuracy during this process, because the models were not perfect. We tried to engineer prompts using few-shot learning methods to teach our model what a good summary was. We even used GPT3 to generate training examples at scale! However, we were always limited by the 2048-token limit. Training data uses up capacity that we need for input.\n\nA strange consequence of few-shot learning is that the model would pick up on the contents and cause our training data to bleed into our summaries. For example, one of our training summaries was a paragraph about Waterloo. When we asked co:here to summarize an article about geological faults, it wrongly claimed that there was one in Waterloo.\n\nWe had a desire to fit our videos into a certain amount of viewing time. We tried to restrict the duration using a token limit, but co:here does not consider the limit when planning its summaries. It sometimes goes into too much detail and misses out on points from later on in the text."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of ⚡️","content":"We are proud of using the co:here platform We are proud that we will be able to start sharing this platform after this hackathon is over We are proud that people will be able to use this We are proud of overcoming our obstacles We were able to accomplish all functionalities Most of all we had fun !"},{"heading":"What we learned ⚡️","content":"We learned so much throughout the course of the hackathon. Natural Language Processing is not a silver bullet. In order to get our models to do what we want, we have to think like them. We didn’t have much experience using NLP but now we will continue to explore more applications for it."},{"heading":"What's next for nu:here ⚡️","content":"Adding features for users to customize and share videos is top priority for us on the engineering side. At the same time, we must address the elephant in the room: accuracy. In our quest to make information accessible and digestible, we must try as hard as we can to guard our users from mis-summarizations. Better models and user feedback can help us get there.\n\nView Video Demo Here (if the Youtube Video does not work): Demo"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"co-here figma firebase google-storage ibm-watson natural-language-processing pexels react tailwind wikipedia"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"homegrown","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/homegrown-htw4ub","tagline":"Every thought of growing your own plants?

Many started home gardens as a hobby or a cool way to grow your own food from the comfort of your own home. However, with the pandemic slowly coming to a close, many may no longer have the time to micromanage their plants, and those who are interested in starting this hobby may not have the patience.
