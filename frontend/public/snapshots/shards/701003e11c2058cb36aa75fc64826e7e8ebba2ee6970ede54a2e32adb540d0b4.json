Coming into this hackathon with little information as to what we as a group wanted to create, it felt like an impossible task to get any meaningful work done within about the 36 hours. The first three hours were spent on hard brainstorming, splashing our mini-white board with as many ideas that we could think of. Simulation of living without glasses, simulation of colorblindness, a calorie fitness app, a Youtube addiction-curber, a Bridge AI. There were so many problems that we wanted to solve, but nothing stood out for all four of us. Right before dinner time hit, I thought about the incredibly cool animations of the old Windows Media Player had. You know, the swirly, trippy, colorful images that played in sync with you song? I thought that’d be incredibly cool to make. Kurt, though, thought of an even better idea: representing an audio file by a singular image. Not everyone was for this idea, initially, as we kind of thought of it as a joke concept at first. Like, how hard could it be to convert bits to bits? It’ll be easy weekend."},{"heading":"Challenges","content":"Challenges started to arise deep into Friday night though. As we thought about it more, we concluded it was a conflict of whether we wanted the image to be a one-to-one conversion or an artistic representation. On one hand, it would be extremely cool and useful to have an image completely represent a sound. It would be great for encoding information in the physical world and act as “QR code” for sound. On the other hand, the idea of seeing a computer-generated picture and immediately understanding what a song’s tone and vibe was extremely satisfying too. We went to sleep, nervous but excited, with an idea that we knew had a lot of potential."},{"heading":"Process","content":"Saturday morning, we drew up the semblance of a plan. The plan was to convert the song’s raw bit data into the fields of the pixels of the image, and that newly created image would then be multiplied by invertible transformation matrices created dependent on analyses of the audio’s unique characteristics (frequency, amplitude, key, length, etc). We each divided the work by section: Ethan primarily worked on the audio-to-image conversion algorithm, Morris worked on the developing our dynamic website, I worked on the transformations, and Kurt was a helper that greatly contributed to all three. In all three, we had major obstacles that weren’t foreseen.\n\nEthan developed two algorithms, one that converts a .wav file to an image and one that converts an image back into a .wav file. For the .wav to image conversion, we assumed that the .wav file would be a 16-bit file as that is what is most common. We needed to convert these 16-bit data points into a 32-bit pixel, so we did the following. We broke up bits 2-16 and assigned them to be bits in the RGB values of a pixel. We distributed the bits such that the most significant bits in the input were the most significant bits in the colors. We then padded the rest of the RGB values such that they were each 8 bits long. Next, we used the first bit (signed bit) in the input to determine the alpha value of the pixel. If the bit was positive the alpha was 255 and if negative the alpha was 128. The exact opposite process was used to turn an image back into a .wav file. The algorithms are designed such that if you run a file through one of the algorithms and then use the outputted file in the other algorithm, the final output will be the original file.\n\nI looked at the characteristics of music and how to extract that information from an audio file. I was able to find the average frequency rather easily, as well as the average amplitude. The one obstacle that I faced was the finding the key. I innocently thought that it would be easy converting the song to a MIDI file and have an algorithm analyze the key. It was not. After 5 hours of searching, I came to the sinking conclusion that the conversion could only take place in Python 2.7, when the rest of the project was being written for Python 3.8. While searches of version control with virtualenv gave me hope, we simply didn’t have enough time to implement it. Saddened but not discouraged, I still wanted to overlay two sin waves of the sound file’s unique frequency and amplitude. But because so much time was spent as a group in developing the website and algorithm, these features had to be ultimately cut. Alas, a project made in less than 2 days won’t always go according to plan."},{"heading":"Finale","content":"Morris and Kurt spent Saturday afternoon finding out exactly what kind of website solution we wanted to go through. We as a group had a little experience with web development, let alone dynamic website development. They juggled with the idea of Firebase with Google Cloud, but the ultimate solution was Flask. With a Frankenstein of google searches and snippets of a previous Flask solution that Ethan worked on, at midnight we achieved perfection: a website that could legitimately take a file upload and not die. We were so excited that I think Morris’s scream at 1 AM woke up the whole dorm."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css flask heroku html5 numpy python scipy"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"writenoise.herokuapp.com"}]},{"project_title":"MaskOn","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/maskon-6dghtp","tagline":"Reduce COVID-19 risk in stores by automatically enforcing PPE and occupancy requirements at the door.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/001/254/104/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 7","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"MLH: Best Hardware Hack Sponsored by Digi-Key"},{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 7","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Top 8 Overall"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"colab","url":null},{"name":"keras","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Many stores require masks and enforce occupancy limits to limit the spread of COVID-19.

It is a Chrome extension that adds subtle enhancements to your Twitter experience which allows you to quickly browse through actionable, crowdsourced links related to a hashtag that you see on your feed. If a particular hashtag on your feed is being used for a particular movement or cause, our extension would allow you to explore ways you can contribute to what’s going on out there. Categories such as ‘Donate’ and ‘Volunteer’ allow you to browse through links within the contribution method of your liking.\n\nWant to donate to a protest relief organization? Want to volunteer your home as a wildfire shelter? Want to know more about the protests in Nigeria regarding SARS? HelpTag can point you in the right direction, instantly."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We focused on building a simple, effective, and robust tool that is paired with a seamless user experience and a clean interface. Having brainstormed the idea through a whiteboard discussion , we were able to define the scope and value propositions of our project early on. We created mockups early on using Figma to explore directions in the visual and interaction design of our solution.\n\nWe created the interface by injecting HTML, CSS, JavaScript into twitter's DOM element through a Chrome Extension . Several libraries were used to achieve the required interaction patterns. These included bootstrap, jQuery, fontAwesome .\n\nWe used Google’s Firebase to create a cloud-based NoSQL Database storing all of our crowdsourced information on resources. The data is stored as JSON and synchronized in real-time to every connected user at all times. We relied heavily on Google Developer Tools for troubleshooting and deployment of the extension on the browser.\n\nFinally, we spent two whole days online on Twitter."},{"heading":"Challenges, accomplishments, and reflections","content":"We ran into several challenges while developing the tool. Understanding the front-end deployment of Twitter was challenging, but necessary to make the necessary UI adjustments to the interface. Deciding what theme to tackle was a challenge as well. We decided to prototype the solution for one theme for the scope of this hackathon. Another challenge was considering the business goals a solution like this could accomplish.\n\nThe team is proud of what they come up within the span of two days. The tool solves a real problem faced by our acquaintances. The team accomplished a good level of attention to detail with the solution.\n\nIn hindsight, we would have wanted to start working on the solution earlier. We had to pivot from another idea because we found this idea more exciting, but we lost a significant chunk of time pursuing another idea."},{"heading":"What's next for HelpTag","content":"Based on our initial brainstorm, there were a few ideas that seemed beyond the scope of the hackathon but added essential value propositions to the product. If we spend more time on building the extension, we have a mini product feature map ready:\n\nPersonalized recommendations. (ex: location-based: events near you) Light and Dark modes to match the display options on Twitter. Link aggregation using correlation scores for various hashtags."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bootstrap chrome css3 firebase html5 javascript jquery twitter"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Bob Was A Rectangle","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/hackgt2020-fvrymo","tagline":"A game of solving puzzles with the IBM Watson AI.

Sometimes we took the leftover food and re-cooked it, but it wouldn't taste the same. In worst cases, the food spoiled and we just had to wast the food.\n\nWe've also found that a lot of people had the same problem and many restaurants around the state were facing the issue of food waste. People usually could not finish their plate and a lot of food went to waste.\n\nWe’ve also found out that food wastage was a very big problem in the states. More than 80 billion pounds of food were thrown away each year and 40% of the US food supply is wasted each year.\n\nSo we came up with this idea: Foodie Buddie."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Foodie Buddie is a food sharing app that connects the customers and restaurants.

Dart and Flutter was a new language / library for all of us to work with during this two-day hackathon. However, we tried to seek help from our emerging mentor as much as possible. By the help of the workshops and mentors, we were able to go through it very well.\n\nThe second obstacle we faced was trying to implement NCR APIs into our product. The APIs were advanced and we had to invest a lot of our time trying to understand how the APIs worked.\n\nThe last obstacle we faced was trying to work across different timezones. Since our team is composed of individuals from three countries, time difference affected the way we cooperate with our team. We had to respect our teammates' personal wellbeing and at the same time also focus on our product for this hackathon."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As an emerging team, we are really proud of learning how to create functional UI for our product and implementing the BSP NCR API. In addition to the technical accomplishments, we are also proud of the concept of our application.\n\nWe came up with an application that promotes the sharing mindset, while at the same time limiting food waste in the world. With COVID19, some people have been struggling more than ever with finding food for themselves. We are proud that this application also provides a helping solution for those people by giving an incentive for the user to donate their acquired points to needed people. They, then, can exchange the points for a warm meal. All in all, with the sharing and caring mindset being promoted, we believe that a positive impact is sure to be generated."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"From very scratch, we were able to create a flutter application. Through this process, we learned both hard and soft skills.\n\nHard Skills:\n\nFrom not even knowing the syntax of dart, self-learning flutter within 24 hours allowed us to develop the skill of how to effectively understand and use language documentations.\n\nThis essential skill allows us to be a fast and adaptive learner in today's rapid technological world. Throughout our learning journey, we also gain some insight into how well-known companies apply the language for professional application development.\n\nSoft Skills:\n\nGaining soft skills are as important as gaining hard skills.\n\nBeing a diverse group, we learned how to collaborate and communicate efficiently with people from different cultural backgrounds. In order for this collaboration and communication to be successful, we had to use several collaborating platforms, such as slack and github.\n\nThroughout all the meetings and shared documents, the most important lesson we learned was how to efficiently split the workload between teammates that live in different time zones."},{"heading":"What's next for Foodie Buddie","content":"Our ultimate goal is to develop and spread our app so that the people who eat less and the people who eat more can swap in real-time and decrease the amount of food wasted in the U.S. as much as possible.\n\nWe plan to gather restaurants and customers who are interested in preserving the earth environment by reducing food waste to join our app. As more and more people join Foodie Buddie, the better our world will become."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android-studio bsp-api dart firebase flutter"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"SALON","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/hackgt2020","tagline":"Realtime public debate platform @ HackGT 2020.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/001/251/021/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 7","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Emerging Hackers: Best in Curriculum Track"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"google-web-speech-api","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"socket.io","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/roaga/HackGT2020"},{"label":"docs.google.com","url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Y-E6RSfOF1gD9ccM6naB9-8kxwzzS6Kg9dO3PM78KrQ/edit?usp=sharing"},{"label":"salon-hackgt.azurewebsites.net","url":"https://salon-hackgt.azurewebsites.net"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"It is clear to see that today's world is a fractured one. Even in this day and age where everyone can talk with virtually anyone, any meaningful conversation is rare. Instead, people turn to places like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook as outlets for mudslinging and creating conflict, with society in a worse state than before they started. The effects of such a confrontational and close-minded society can be felt and have been for several years. Ever since the 2016 election, the nation has been on a downward spiral, almost to the point where it's nearly impossible to debate without a fight. With our application, we hope to revive what the forefathers valued so much: Civil Discussion."},{"heading":"Solution","content":"For us, this application is more than just a place people can talk about various topics. We want to fundamentally change the way people approach contentious issues. As firm believers in the idea that positive change only comes from constructive conversation, we have developed a platform that not only allows for telephone-style debates, but also transcribes and analyzes the conversation, creates text posts, and cultivates a space for meaningful, productive discussion.\n\nFirst, if a user wants to have a discussion, they will sign into their account and search for the issue of their choice. They then can click the call button and wait for someone to match-up with. As they debate, their conversation is transcribed and arguments are analyzed and flagged if they are unsupported by evidence, claim a fact, or are opinionated/emotional. We were careful to consider psychology--this way, discourse always remains civil and productive, without bias or a disdain of being corrected. When the call ends, everything is automatically uploaded as a post for all to access and explore different, thorough perspectives on important issues."},{"heading":"Technical Details and Challenges","content":"We used React to create the entire front end, Firebase and Firestore for authentication and data storage, Google's Web Speech API for speech-to-text, Express.js and Socket.io for our real-time server, and our own original algorithm for live argument analysis.\n\nAll of us were relatively new to React, Express.js, and Socket.io, making this project challenging overall. The high quality presentation and the many features we strove for also added to the challenge. We had particular trouble with the nuances of converting speech-to-text data with traditional chatbox text into a single transcript with proper timing and accuracy. However, we pulled through with our own speech timing system, which also managed the timing of our flagging system."},{"heading":"Accomplishments","content":"As students who are cognizant of the things going on in the world around us, we know the country is becoming more and more divided by the day. We are happy that we took the opportunity to create something that could be the start of real change. We are also proud of the technical skills we have developed, the polished final product, and the experiences we have shared as a team."},{"heading":"Next Steps","content":"One major step we want to take is to make the generated content from debates more discoverable with a custom feed for each user. Another step is to allow more than two people in a call, allowing for a wider exchange of ideas in each discussion. We may also want to create a more robust flagging system. We could also implement a business model; one possibility is to compensate users who record lengthy, high-quality debates and charge users for reading lots of transcripts, while another is to sell the software to schools and other organizations. To bring this to the real world, we would first approach classrooms and then move on to the general population."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"express.js firebase google-web-speech-api javascript react socket.io"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com docs.google.com salon-hackgt.azurewebsites.net"}]},{"project_title":"Excessible","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/excessible","tagline":"Excessible works to connect grocery stores with food banks in need and makes excess food accessible!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/252/861/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 7","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Emerging Hackers: Most Impactful"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css3","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"google-maps","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps"},{"name":"html5","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/shreyasanthana/ExcessibleHackGT"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Within the past year, food banks across the country have reported a 40% increase in the need for emergency food assistance.

Once you have received your personalized selection of baskets from our recommendation engine, you can choose which one to order. Then Buzzbasket will create an order for you in NCR Silver so that the information goes directly to the business and they can make your basket!\n\nWe also have a basket recommender for the small/local business to use. This system pulls in sales, inventory, and item information from NCR Silver in order to help the business decide what to put in the basket. It totals up the cost so they can easily see the profits it will generate as well as tries to use items that they have a large stock of that may be going to expire soon.\n\nBy using Buzzbasket, you're helping to support your local businesses during COVID-19 when they may not be getting as much business as usual."},{"heading":"What's next for BuzzBasket","content":"In the future we want to utilize the delivery partner API and coupon API to expand Buzzbasket to more stores and offer incentives for consumers to buy with us.\n\nFurther down the line we can help eliminate food waste by large food chains as well.

Because of COVID-19, small businesses in the area are suffering, and it is hard for them to optimize their supply chain process. One of the team members went to a local donut shop and bought a few donuts early in the morning. The store owner seemed flustered and began mentioning how she has seen a recent uptick in sales for vegan donuts. She was not prepared to handle more vegan donut orders than originally predicted and wished she knew beforehand that this would be an issue. Thus, Junction was born. The goal was mainly to come up with an idea to help merchants not only gain business during a time that is tough for small business owners but also to provide merchants with data to optimize their supply planning. We created an app that can be accessed as a consumer or merchant. Both parties are benefitted by Junction."},{"heading":"What it Does","content":"Consumption Junction, what is your function?\n\nJunction connects merchants and consumers through one platform. On the merchant side, Junction tracks data of times for peak sales, commonly ordered meals, and regular orders, and displays these figures for the merchant to better optimize their supply chain needs. These metrics make it easier for a business owner to take advantage of specific foods or times that can increase their profits. On the consumer side, the app allows the user to view restaurants and order food as usual. Additionally, users are provided with updated data regarding time to receive an order, whether it be through dining in, pick up, or delivery. Aiding small businesses at a time of need is crucial, so the app from the consumer side ties in incentives to encourage users to try eating local."},{"heading":"How We Built It","content":"The prototype for the consumer side of the Junction app was built using NCR’s Figma design. Junction was then implemented for both the consumer and merchant side using JavaScript and Next.js. NCR’s business services API was used to test API calls sent into the Next.js API routes. These API routes would connect to Google’s google-auth-library to authenticate a service account with a JWT, thereby allowing us to read and write off of a Google sheet as a backend for order history. Python was used to pull consumer data from Google Sheets to visualize the data for merchants through matplotlib."},{"heading":"Challenges We Ran Into","content":"Overarchingly, challenges we faced included lack of time and lack of prior knowledge. As we came up with an idea, we recognized that it would not be the easiest to achieve with the computer science we strictly learned in school. In just a small amount of time, we would not only have to finish our project, but also learn about how to implement new resources along the way. This was a major challenge for us all."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that We're Proud Of","content":"This was the first time any of us have used Figma to create a professional prototype. We are also proud that we were able to learn how to utilize NCR's API and quickly use it to implement a functioning web app. Most importantly, we are all proud of how we picked up skills we needed to utilize to reach our end goal. Once we had a theme and a goal decided, we went at it with full force. On several occasions, we stumbled and realized we did not know exactly how to attack an issue. One such example was when Google's 'google-auth-library' didn't interact well with Next.js's API routing. However, we did not waiver on our topic or end 'goal' just because of a lack of prior knowledge. When we had a lack of order data in our Google sheets backend, we created Python scripts to generate thousands of sample order data to input in the sheet. When we struggled to implement an ordering system into our webapp, we researched React hooks as a solution. When we dealt with time restraints, we honed in on what really matters to Junction--providing resources for local businesses. As time went by, we learned how to use several additional resources to complete our project within the time constraint and to the best of our ability."},{"heading":"What We Learned","content":"We learned important design principles from NCR’s design workshop, which were immediately implemented when using Figma. From an NCR workshop, we also picked up the importance of making apps for consumers more exciting and interactive. Gamifying was a concept we were drawn to and decided to implement in our prototype. Our ‘game’ revolves around collecting ingredients needed to bake a cookie (which is the equivalent of completing the challenge). The ingredients are only collected by completing a series of events which include ordering from local restaurants, leaving reviews, and more. After completing these tasks, the user will receive a reward such as in-app credit. We also learned React hooks, Python's matplotlib, Next.js, API routes, Postman, and Heroku hosting."},{"heading":"What's Next for Junction","content":"Now that we have thoroughly thought through our idea, we know just how passionate we are about it. We aim to extend and implement the functionality shown in the prototype on Figma. This would make Junction a more comprehensive platform, and hopefully a platform that is beneficial and aesthetically pleasing. Our overarching goal, throughout all changes, is to make sure Junction caters to communities and people that we feel need the most help at this time."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api css figma google-spreadsheets googleapis html javascript matplotlib ncr-business-services ncr-design-system python react react-spring"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com www.figma.com junctionhackgt.herokuapp.com"}]},{"project_title":"Scrubs | Helping Nurses Help Us","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/scrubs-improving-nursing-communication","tagline":"Streamlined communication platform designed specifically for health care staff, aimed to fix the outdated call system used in current nursing units for patient requests.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/265/587/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 7","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Anthem: Personalized, digital medicine in the age of COVID and beyond"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"react-native","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native"},{"name":"socket.io","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/MattLiCodes/NursingApp"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Ideation","content":"During our ideation process, one of the first things that we were able to relate to as a group is the unique perspective we share regarding the COVID-19 pandemic.

Because Facebook and Instagram have different capabilities, the filters for each platform have different options. When the filter opens, the user has options to chose which method of pixelation they want to use. The instructions for each specific method are below:\n\nInstagram\n\nAudio Analysis - This method analyzes the data from a spectrum equalizer and automatically pixelates the background if a certain average frequency threshold is exceeded.\n\nSlider - This method is also very intuitive. It just adds a slider on the right side of the screen that the user can modify to a wanted level.\n\nWorld AR Block - This is the most interesting method of pixelation. This method allows you to an embed an emblem of our logo anywhere in the world. Our filter will remember the location of this object no matter where you look, or if you switch between front and back camera. The only thing you need to keep in mind for this option is that the father away the object, the more pixelated your background will become.\n\nFacebook\n\nHand Control - This method is both intuitive and fun to allow for creativity! If you put your hand towards the camera, it will further pixelate the background. If you put your hand away from the camera, it will unpixelate the background.\n\nWorld AR Block - This is the most interesting method of pixelation.

Through creating an initially simple pixelation AR filter, we realized that by adding additional customization we enable users to utilize their own creativity in making skits specializing in reveals or hiding things."},{"heading":"What it Does","content":"PicselAR gives users a way to pixelate their background through various means (e.g., hand gesture/slider, distance to a virtual object, and audio level). It also gives rise to skit creation with Instagram Reels as demonstrated above.\n\nHand Gesture/Slider\n\nThis option grants users the most convenient degree of customization over how their background is perceived. It is most useful if one has no need to pixelate their background or it needs to be pixelated the entire time regardless of the context it is used in.\n\nVirtual Object\n\nWe believe this option to be the least useful in a professional setting but the one with the most potential for creativity. Users can place an object somewhere in a virtual 3D space and the camera's distance to it determines the background's pixelation. This feature could be used in creating short horror skits when paired with a dark environment or for creating skits that involve movement.\n\nAudio Level\n\nWhile it cannot be easily conveyed through a visual format, if the user's microphone picks up audio above a certain threshold, the background will be pixelated as much as possible. We envision this being used to prevent a person's home life being exposed in case someone begins yelling or barges in to their room. On the more light-hearted side of things, it could be used in a skit in which someone attempts to hide something from someone."},{"heading":"How We Built it","content":"We built PicselAR using Facebook's Spark AR software.

The ability to upvote or downvote, as well as the functionality to comment on news, is one of the most unique and crucial characteristics of HackNews. More specifically, readers are able to upvote for news that they consider as credible and unbiased while downvoting non-credible news articles. The comment section lays right next to the news entity in order to accomplish the concept of a user-friendly design. Generally speaking, the algorithm utilizes an upvote and downvote result from user voting to predict the credibility of each article. The credibility rank interprets the voting results with equal weight, and compute the credibility index of each news. The news is ranked corresponding to this credibility index in descending order. To present the credibility more user-friendly and visually-appealing, we implemented a gradient bar with dynamic color-changing that shows the degree of credibility. In detail, the bar represents the most trustworthy news as bright green, the most unreliable articles as bright red, and degrees of red and green shadows as different levels of credibility.

Additionally, node and react take up more memory than IBM Cloud Foundry allows for free Docker instances. As a result, the build needed to be optimized by starting from an alpine container and copying over only the necessary static files generated by React.

Our next task was to decide on the metrics to quantify the quality of the news. Obviously, there are a lot of ways to define the quality of news/information among which relevance, facticity, style, potential impact play a big role. However, measuring these features is nothing but trivial and this is especially true for languages with poor data resources and relevant technologies. As a team, we spent a considerable amount of time over defining a metric that is meaningful -> does it actually capture the quality of news? simple -> is it straightforward and easily comprehensible? universal -> is it language-agnostic?

We use this sentiment to detect biases of the author towards specific subjects and the author’s political preference which is incorporated in our final analysis of all of the individual algorithms we developed to polish the existing ranking algorithms. The goal of this sentiment analysis is to contextualize the article that readers may click on. Finally, we use a custom Tensorflow backend to detect hate speech and other languages which we consider to render an article as nonconstructive and written only to incite violence.

The back-end aggregator web-scrapes news outlets (we chose NDTV, The Indian Express, and Deccan Chronicles) and pulls out political articles. Then each is run through VADER to determine their overall sentiment, but explicitly just the magnitude of such (since high negative can be just as bad as high positive). Higher magnitudes are perceived to be worse sources of news than others since this implies that the author's word choice can imply strong biases. This, along with the article link, article title, and article summary, is compiled into a list.\n\nThis list is taken in by a Data Access Object (DAO) that proceeds to write this scraped data to our instance of DataStax Astra for long-term storage and relieves the need to rescan unless a new source with more links needs to be examined. This data is stored in a tabular fashion (due to Apache Cassandra's structure) and operations for queries and inserts are done solely in CQL (Cassandra Query Language) which looks an awful lot like SQL. However, the database is a NoSQL database in nature (even though it still returns results in ResultSets).\n\nThe front-end displays the database data following an API call for queries. The data is sorted by score in ascending order with the weakest sentiment towards the top and the stronger wordings towards the bottom. Data can be retrieved in two ways: Reload and Direct\n\nAdditionally, we implemented our own summarization tool which allows the reader to skip over the hassle of navigating and reading the news source. Aditya coded a term frequency-inverse document frequency algorithm and then grammar reconstruction function with the aid of nltk to make the important words and phrases not sound like a random string of vernacular and rather a smooth flow of thought akin to human writing.\n\nReload\n\nThis calls on the server to reperform the search as something may have changed like adding additional data sources. The server executes the web scraping function then loads that new data into the database. This results in a simple output of declaring that the process has finished which prompts the front-end to redirect to the news list out. This is unique because it allows our system to process dynamic changes in the news and subsequently parses and updates the feed (assuming you consistently reload, also the database will update daily).\n\nDirect\n\nThis allows the user to instantly access the news sites we currently have processed and see their scores on the UI we created. Each site has its title, score, and summary visible. Clicking on each of the cards will open a new tab to the article link. Queries to Astra are notoriously quick, with this site loading faster than the same coming out of MongoDB or DynamoDB. The new tab was intentional as to not cause reload errors if the user was redirected from the news list."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Flask to design a back-end server to respond to our React-based front-end/UI. The React app is proxied such that we do not need to use CORS to send requests. It effectively comes from a single port in the application. The backend is connected to an instance of DataStax Astra, one of the fastest cloud versions of Apache Cassandra. A table was initialized in the DataStax Astra Studio. We created a database model representing a news site consisting of the following:\n\nlink: text score: float summary: text float: text\n\nThis would be stored in a corresponding table to be retrieved later. On the front end, we included functionality for a reload, but also a direct query which queries Astra, sorts the data accordingly, and displays it on the UI as \"The News!\""},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Astra was notoriously hard to set up. You not only need a driver (which is only available inside the dashboard), but als a singleton session, CQL, and proper formatting instructions. Tony spent almost 3 hours just attaching the connections and services in order to get the proper data flow. Initially, I tried to run a CQL to String function on schema.cql , but gave up somewhere in the middle and initialized the table on a CQL notebook in the DataStax Astra Studio.

After taking off manually, the plane can circle around a pre-designated area, playing music and shining lights so that people below can enjoy entertainment while social distancing. Additionally, the PiPlane tracking goggles use computer vision to assist a pilot in locating the aircraft while taking off and landing to improve safety in an otherwise hazardous environment."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"PiPlane was built over the course of about 13 hours during the beginning of the event. The plane itself is built using primarily laser cut foam board pieces held together with hot glue, with the exception of certain areas such as the landing gear which required more robust materials like steel rods. The laser cut pieces come from the Flite Test Guinea Pig RC Plane, however many areas of it were modified for our needs, such as the landing gear which were made sturdier and the payload area. The payload of PiPlane includes a disco ball and custom built speaker as well as the autopilot and electronics. The disco ball is simply a cheap OMERIL Disco Light bought on amazon.\n\nThe speaker uses a sealed Tupperware box and a passive radiator to improve the bass frequency performance. The amplifier and Bluetooth combo board are soldered and mounted separately in the fuselage to also improve the reception.\n\nFor the autopilot, we used a RadioLink Pixhawk with an SE100 GPS. Mission planner was used to upload Ardupilot Plane firmware as well as the flight plan which were used to control the autopilot. Most of the wires for the Pixhawk were included with it, however we did have to use a separate PPM encoder for the Spektrum receiver we used since it did not send direct PWM signals to the Pixhawk. We used a single 2200 mAH 3S lithium polymer battery for the controls of the plane in addition to a single 1300 mAH 5S lithium polymer battery for the speaker and disco light.\n\nThe algorithm behind the PiPlane tracking goggles is implemented in Python and relies primarily on the OpenCV and NumPy libraries. First, feature points are extracted from a video frame and stored in memory. This is done using ORB feature extraction through OpenCV. These points are then compared to the previous frame’s feature points using OpenCV’s Brute Force Matcher algorithm to determine possible matches. The best matches are then analyzed using a variety of methods, and a bounding box for the plane is generated. The input image with the bounding box shown is then projected to the screen.\n\nRegarding the hardware of the PiPlane tracking goggles, we attached a USB streaming webcam to a pair of FatShark video goggles, and plugged both of these into a laptop to run the PiPlane location algorithm."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The first major challenge we faced had to do with getting to Pixhawk to interface with the receiver and transmitter since each used a different method for channel mapping. While this is usually standard, we discovered that the receiver used a different channel mapping than the Pixhawk and transmitter. While the Pixhawk and transmitter did use the same channel mapping during calibration, it was further discovered that the channel mapping parameters in the Pixhawk parameters was incorrect so these were also changed.\n\nAnother major challenge was that the Bluetooth 5.0 receiver that we used had significant trouble picking up Bluetooth signals despite being a Bluetooth 5 module. Through testing we discovered that pointing the antenna from the phone towards the module as well as using a piece of aluminium foil to create a baffle around the receiver helped significantly increase its range.\n\nThirdly, we ran into the challenge of building the plane in a timely manner since we realized that we had significantly overestimated our own building abilities, which did end up meaning that we had less time than anticipated to test the autopilot.\n\nLastly, it was difficult to get the autopilot to actually function as there were a lot of parameters that needed to be changed for our specific plane. Furthermore, the arming system for the plane posed significant challenges to circumvent as the software was designed for drones and this meant that a large portion of the time in Ardupilot was spent trying to get this to work. The result was that we had basically no time to tune the PID settings to allow for an ideal flight by the autopilot."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We had four main accomplishments that we are proud to have achieved during this hackathon. The first was that we managed to solve the range issue we were having on the Bluetooth module using the aforementioned aluminium foil baffle. The second major accomplishment was that we were able to have the plane actually take-off and fly at a weight of over 4.5 pounds. The third accomplishment was that we were able to verify that the autopilot worked with the aircraft we had created as there were significant challenges in the domain. The last major accomplishment was that we were able to make a vision tracking supplement for the plane which functioned to a reasonable degree, even in low-light conditions."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"The single most important thing we learned was the importance of budgeting extra time for seemingly simple tasks. When we thought up the project, we didn’t think that the plane would take anywhere near as much time to build as it actually did. We believed that we would be able to start testing in the early morning on Saturday, and would be done before rush hour. However, the build took much longer than we thought and we didn’t even start testing until after 4 in the afternoon. Nevertheless, this ended up being a blessing in disguise: we never would’ve thought to create the PiPlane tracking goggles had it not started to get dark while we still needed to test."},{"heading":"What's next for PiPlane","content":"We would like to improve on the autopilot which we didn't have time to completely tune and test the plane in more of an urban setting. We would also like to automate the take-off and landing of the plane, as well as increase its flight time.\n\nArdupilot: https://ardupilot.org/plane/"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ardupilot opencv python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:49:35.014442Z"}}
