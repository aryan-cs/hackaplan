A symphony that began nearly 75,000 years ago with the discovery of ancient instruments, has evolved into a majestic crescendo. From the very first flutes and stringed instruments, we have made our way to the piano and electronic instruments. Inspired by the revolutionary original Theremin, we combine modern electronic music synthesis with computer vision and machine learning to reinvent musical performance."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Brings music to your finger tips, literally . Theremin allows unleashes the musician in you, where you are the embodiment of the music that you produce. With the power of AI, you become the conductor, and your movements shape the symphony. Theremin is a music generation software that produces drums, chords, and melodies by analyzing your hand gestures and movements.\n\nNot only does is it able to recognize your hand poses, it also uses a machine learning model to generate great-sounding melodies based on the chords you are playing.\n\nYour left hand controls the chords, your right hand the melody. Open and close your hands to activate their respective sounds. Make a Rockstar sign with your hand to activate the drums!\n\nHit record and enjoy creating music realtime!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used MediaPipe to get hand pose and gesture information and Magenta.js and Tone.js to generate melodies and audio using synths and samples. We also used Teoria.js for music theory."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We initially had plans to include multi-player as well as body-pose data. However, we had compatibilty and optimization issues that forced us to reduce complexity. This ended up having a silver lining, in that it allowed us to be more creative with the degrees of freedom we had available."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Something that we all celebrated was the generation of different chords based on the hand placement. This kicked off our project, because it was at this point that we were able to map the music with the gestures successfully. Ultimately, we wanted to parse pose data into music in a way that felt intuitive and natural. This required considerable effort, but I think we achieved it."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned a lot more than some frame works this hackathon! We learned quite a bit of music theory to produce melodies based on chords, and we learned about the process of electronic music synthesis from the unique perspective of code. Learning about the gesture recognition API was really fun for all of us."},{"heading":"What's next for theremin","content":"One of the first things that we would like to add to theremin is the possibility for more than one person to generate music. Secondly we would also like to add an option to produce more variation in the generated music by giving users an option to read in body movements too. Finally, we would like to add more instruments and expand our music generation capabilities. (Possibly enough for theremin to be a comprehensive music production software one day!)"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css3 html5 javascript tone.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com boilertheremin.netlify.app"}]},{"project_title":"Gester - A Gesture Game Library and Visual Arcade (Table 83)","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/gester-a-gesture-based-arcade-platform","tagline":"A way to play games by moving your hands!

However, we struggled to come up with both a library to do so with and an idea that we all liked. That's when we decided to focus on building a platform with the goal of allowing others to build gesture-based games. Specifically, we wanted to streamline this process through a game library so that building games is quick and efficient."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Game Library\n\nOur game library serves as a PyGame wrapper around our Gesture Library in order to serve developers a seamless experience for integrating gesture input into games. We found PyGame to be feature lacking and overly verbose in its requirements for getting a game off the ground. As such, we have expedited the experience of developing games through our custom game design architecture.\n\nGesture Library\n\nBy adapting a specific section of Google's early release MediaPipe, Hand Landmarkers, we are able to (relatively) easily fetch the coordinates of hand joints the model recognizes on camera. We then detailed gestures and specifications for those gestures to present an easy API to interested developers. Rather than have to configure and wrap a model themselves, they can plug-and-play by giving a single callback to our library.\n\nArcade\n\nIn order to prove the efficiency of our gesture based game library, we built several games that show off many different features. These were created to showcase the power of the platform and aimed to maximize personal enjoyment.\n\nPong - The first game built shows off the most basic features of the game library: basic shape rendering, collision detection, and most importantly gesture support. The user battles the computer in the classic game from the 70s while controlling their paddle with their hand. 2048 - In this seemingly simple math puzzle game, the player is able to slide around powers of 2 by wagging their finger from side to side. Through enough trial and error they are able to achieve the 2048 tile. Simon Says - Simon Says demonstrates the adaptability of our gesture recognition. The player is tasked with showing off their knowledge of various hand signs by demonstrating them in front of Simon when asked. Box Stacker - In this game you are granted control of a platform (through your hand) and must control it to catch and stack boxes. Watch out though; the box-a-pocalypse is near. Casino Simulation - Our game engine offers texture and sound loading. This is demonstrated by the thrilling experience of running the slots. Pikachu Tomogachi - A game where you can feed Pikachu berries as he wanders around in a field. Lots and lots and lots of berries... A tranquil, peaceful, calm, and otherworldly experience."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"All parts of the project were written in Python. We used PyEnv for environment manager and Poetry for dependencies. Our gesture library wrapped MediaPipe and utilized OpenCV for video processing. The game library took advantage of PyGame. Any arcade games were built solely with our own library."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Setting up our environment and Poetry was difficult as none of us had worked in a large team on a large Python project before. Luckily, having background in NPM/Cargo helped. MediaPipe was difficult to get up and running. There isn't a ton of documentation around the product and thus we had to do a lot of experimentation. Furthermore, it isn't as featured as we expected and needed to write an entire library in order to ship the input to the game library. We used a GitHub submodule for the separate gesture library built to support the game library and this was difficult due to our unfamiliarity with submodules. Architecting the system and trying to create our API ahead of time was challenging due to our uncertainty about the end product."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Creation of a game interface on top of MediaPipe and PyGame. A series of fun games that show off individual features of the library. Staying up all night."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Although python is famous for its ease of use, it is unmistakably a feature filled language with a large amount of depth. Developing a library for the use for others required many high level decisions that needed to use many advanced features of python. While developing games we also required a create deal of creativity in order get our games working with a library that was not battle-tested."},{"heading":"What's next for Gester","content":"We hope that the many developers at the hackathon will see the platform and get inspired to build their own games on the platform!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"game mediapipe opencv poetry pygame python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Boilerchain","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/boilerchain","tagline":"Boilerchain is Purdue's only open-source cryptocurrency.

To make mining the currency on a browser possible, the proof-of-work algorithm is extremely weak."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"The blockchain itself was built in Python, using various cryptographic protocols like hashing and concepts like proof-of-work. The blockchain (and user information like balances and blocks mined) are stored in Redis Cloud for fast access. This information is made visible to the web app through the use of FastAPI. The web app was built with React, Vite, ChakraUI, and TailwindCSS. Authentication was handled through AWS Amplify, which is also used on the backend to validate requests. Finally, Docker files are used to allow for easy virtualization."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"While I was familiar with most of the frontend technologies, I had none with the backend technologies. I had to learn Redis, FastAPI, and Bruno with no experience, which was a bit of a learning curve. I also had no idea how to build a cryptocurrency, and that involved a lot of reading and understanding how they work. Finally, I had never written a Dockerfile before, and that took some experimenting and A LOT of Stack Overflow."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"While the frontend is visually appealing, I had plenty of experience with that coming in, so it's not my main takeaway from this hackathon. Rather, as mentioned earlier, it was taking Redis, FastAPI, and Docker from zero experience to production-level application that I'm most proud of. And let's not forget the actual cryptocurrency that I built!"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"The main things I learned were of course the theory behind cryptocurrencies and the plethora of technologies that I used. Besides that, the biggest takeaway for me is that I can build a quality app in 36 hours if I set my mind to it. I won't lie – this was incredibly exhausting, especially for a solo developer. But I'm extremely proud of what I made, and I see great things ahead."},{"heading":"What's next for Boilerchain","content":"Right now, only the actual blocks are cryptographically secured; the transactions are not. Real-world cryptocurrencies also cryptographically secure these as well, and this is something that I would implement given more time. The other major difference from a real-world cryptocurrency is the centralization. In Boilerchain, the Redis database is the single source of truth. In the real-world, cryptocurrencies are decentralized and truth is determined via consensus protocols. Unfortunately, distributed networks and consensus protocols were not things I was familiar with, and as a graduate-level course (CS 505), were not things I was going to be able to learn in 36 hours. Given more time, I would learn and implement a decentralized version of Boilerchain. Furthermore, the cryptographic protocol is very weak (otherwise you wouldn't be able to mine it in a browser). Future iterations of Boilerchain would move away from browser mining and increase the security of the underlying blockchain. Finally, due to time constraints, I was unable to deploy the docker container onto the domain I bought, boilerchain.us. This is definitely something I'm interested in doing after this hackathon is over."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bruno chakraui docker fastapi python react redis tailwindcss typescript vite"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"PROsody","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/prosody-zfge65","tagline":"Mastering Public Speaking with AI-Enhanced Insight","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/727/738/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Boilermake XI","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-xi.devpost.com/","prize_name":"iPad"},{"hackathon_name":"Boilermake XI","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-xi.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Auth0"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"mysql","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"okta","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/okta"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/AadiD123/presentation-analyser"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"In a world where public speaking has gained unprecedented importance, especially post-COVID, our team was motivated to create a tool that enhances presentation skills.

The quiz continues with more randomly generated letters until the user feels confident in their ability to read Braille!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used a Seeduino Lotus and its associated Grove sensors for output and feedback and a stepper motor for accuracy in the Braille Bananza Box. In addition, we 3D modeled and printed the case for the box to reduce 'distraction' on the surface like particulates that could impair the tactile sensation."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"On the mechanical side, we had some difficulty starting to use the hardware initially, as we did not have experience with the stepper motor we used. We also changed plans for how the Braille rack would slide across halfway through the design, so our final proof of concept doesn't move as effectively as we would've liked. Finally, we wanted to play a recording of each letter, but struggled with and were ultimately unable to use the Seeduino together with an SD card with audio files recorded."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As a team, we put together a relatively significant project in a short period of time! We learned a lot and came up with a project that we thought was useful, challenging, and beneficial to a significant community of people."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"As members of our team focused on different areas, we had different things we learned. One member of our team refined her 3D modeling skills and found an easier way to separate large bodies to print in separate pieces. Another member of our team looked into audio output using different speakers. The third member of our team learned how to interface with Arduino components, and spent a lot of time researching the physics behind stepper motors."},{"heading":"What's next for Braille Bananza","content":"The first next step would be to polish up some of the things that were unable to come entirely to fruition for the demonstration; an improved slider and spoken letter audio output being the two most important. However, we had several other ideas to improve upon it as well. First, we would make the learning process more effective by utilizing a spaced repetition system, where the microcontroller would remember what letters the user has memorized well and reviews them less than the more commonly incorrect letters. In a future iteration, we would also like for the Braille Bananza Box to have a second mode for intermediate to advanced learners, where it would display a sentence one letter at a time. Ultimately, this might also be able to be used as an alternative to text-to-speech."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino c grove prusa-slicer solidworks"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Boilergrams","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/boilergrams","tagline":"Boilergrams: Decode the puzzle, conquer the words.
