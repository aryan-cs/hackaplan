Based on the data, users can set productivity goals by automatically limiting their time spent on websites they select to be “distracting”.

DiscoverTab opens an entirely new interface that provides smaller, better-built companies who truly have innovated quality websites a direct platform against these established companies. This innovative marketing tool ensures companies that they will be targeting interested users. The core technology behind this creates a linkage; once a user visits a competitor website, a company’s website would be suggested along with a chosen one line pitch. This finally would allow the up-and-coming theSkimm.com to target users who have visited the established cnn.com. This direct competition is driven by ever-growing start-up websites who want exposure. This marketing strategy could also be used for organizations like scarlethacks who are looking for students that have visited websites like wildhacks. Or nonprofits like ProjectVision.com, who are looking for volunteers who have visited Chicago Boys and Girls Club’s website. The small investment into paying for this possible retrafficking allows smaller companies to finally showcase against their established competitors on a equal playing field.

Yawn detection was implemented using a face detection perpetual interface in opencv CV_HAAR_SCALE_IMAGE.

The training consists in a set of images, divided into “positive” samples and “negative” samples. The positive samples are instances of the object class of interest and the “negative”, images that don’t contain the object of interest. This interface has been referred from http://www.xavigimenez.net/blog/2010/02/face-detection-how-to-find-faces-with-opencv/ After the detection of eyes and mouth we use thresholding and pattern iteration technique to fin if the eye are closed or yawning happens consistently over a considerable number of frames.

The Eye Aspect Ratio which decides if a blink is detected in consecutive frames in the video captured is a critical part of it.

The website has a text editor on the left and will run the selected code in the box on the right, similar to W3schools or CodeAcademy. However, with CodeWeGo, students and adults can learn HTML/CSS/JavaScript in their native language using tags and keywords. For example, instead of using a tag like \"table\", CodeWeGo accepts, and translates the tag \"mesa\" (mesa is the Spanish word for table). In this project, we only added a Spanish as a language option due to time constraints.\n\nWhat is the problem you’re solving?\n\nCodeWeGo solves the language barrier in learning web development. With CodeWeGo, those that wouldn't necessarily try to learn web development due to the confusion language barriers creates, will now have an opportunity to learn in an easier, more comfortable environment. Learning programming is becoming more and more popular all over the world. Why should there still be a language barrier? From our research, we could not find any code learning system specifically made for non-English speakers which used native language tags.\n\nWe have two modes: Tutorial and SandBox. The Tutorial mode provides a brief explanation about HTML and how to use the tags. For simplicity and demonstration sake, we have kept the tutorial explanations themselves in English. In the SandBox mode, the user can use it as a text editor and export their project as a translated HTML file in English.\n\nWho are users and/or customers?\n\nOur users and customers would be non-English speaking children 8-18 years-old and adults worldwide. Although we currently only made a Spanish version, we hope to expand to more languages and reach more people worldwide.\n\nWhat’s currently missing that they need and which your solution provides?\n\nThe world is currently missing a way to learn web development/programming in another language.

Centralized reward system. ( Makes making various accounts for each store redundant) Simple and Clean Curated list ranked by sentiment analysis of reviews.

Avid couponers and online shoppers are the main demographic. The information age of today continually expands the user base due to the meteoric rise of online shopping.\n\nWhat’s currently missing that they need and which your solution provides? Placing your camera over the logo of a brand you wish to buy from will yield all the promotional codes right before your eyes (with results automated to refresh every 30 minutes). Compared to having to go to a website, search for the brand, and manually look for everything yourself, the process is infinitely streamlined."},{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Why not make saving money an even more convenient action?

A confidence factor was also instantiated to avoid obscure shapes from interfering with the logo detection. The most challenging part was allowing logo detection even if the phone is oriented at an angle. This required the SIFT function in OpenCV (which apparently required an extension to the library that regular OpenCV does not have). After, web scraping occurs with the said brands on Groupon, and the discount codes are retrieved. The data is put into a database using mySQL and the information can be viewed from an web application that supports Oculus Rift (in case your couponing needs necessitate virtual reality). The information updates are also automated through node-schedule (which keeps the coupons relevant)."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We were planning to demo using the Alienware laptop that was checked out from the MLH hardware station, but Windows made everything furiously difficult with installing necessary packages and dependencies to be able to make the project run on that computer.\n\nThe original plan was to also use Google Cloud Vision and the logo detector that was available through that method, but setting the GOOGLE_APPLICATIONS_CREDENTIALS environment variable was also made impossible through Windows.
