When revisiting some of those tutorials we were unbelieving of its simplicity and decided to make a quick mock up fully expecting failure. When the test was in fact a success our team was impressed by the effect as a result of the simple setup to make a 2D space look like a 3D hologram when designed with the right visual elements. We then started considering the theme of the hack-a-thon as well as our display to create ideas that would take advantage of both. Initially we started considering retro games and something that could make use of the 3D perspective. Eventually we got inspired to make it so the user could interact with the display in a tactile way using a hand sensor, but when unity physics proved to be a bit too challenging on top of everything else for 36 hours we pivoted to using the gestures and display to create a fun new gaming experience."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Holo-cade is a modified version of the classic space rails shooter arcade game StarFox with holographic effects that would be displayed on a holographic display and be controlled just with the users hand rather than a controller.

The user interacts with holo-cade through the leap motion sensor that detects hand gestures that have then been mapped to certain actions in the game. The main display is a mod of star fox made on unity to take advantage of the holographic display and its visual effects."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Hardware issues: Slow computers, compatibility, setup Fabrication: laser cutter trouble Cool technology what can we do with it Using unity: Good physics for interactive game and setting it up for sensor interaction"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Getting the sensor working and having it control the game/system The simple elegance of the actual hologram and it's design Modding a game on unity when not having used it prior"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learnt some curious things about the nature of optics since the hologram only displays on one side of the plastic, shows double depending on thickness and layers. We learnt the basics of unity such as textures, physics and assets. We learnt about how the leap motion sensor works and interacts with a computer."},{"heading":"What's next for Holo-cade","content":"Short term, we would like to get a better display to improve user experience by reducing lag and increasing graphics quality. A mid term goal to increase viability would be to try and run the games through an on system processor rather than displaying from our computers. And lastly, our long term goal would be trying out new games with more complex physics to take more advantage of the full range of hand gestures detectable by the leap motion sensor we are using. Later the gesture mapping technology could also be used to improve accessibility by detecting sign language or allowing for gesture based control for those who may struggle to use a traditional laptop UI."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"adobe-illustrator hardware sensor unity"}]},{"project_title":"CODA","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/coda-wzqit9","tagline":"CODA is a retro-themed music rhythm game that teaches players American Sign Language!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/271/538/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 9","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt-9.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Place Overall"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"figma","url":null},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"scss","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scss"},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"}],"external_links":[{"label":"jcrunjie.github.io","url":"https://jcrunjie.github.io/HackGT9-CODA-Website/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/iJragon/CODA"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Our inspiration comes from the movie CODA , which stands for Child of Deaf Adults. This movie increased our awareness of people with disabilities and thus made us ponder ways to help them. We try to find ways to make society more inclusive of deaf people, which is a minority group. We think it would be beneficial to increase the spread of American Sign Language (ASL). If more people know ASL, more people could communicate with deaf people and thus make them more integrated into society. We need an incentive for the public to learn ASL, and we think the best approach is to gamify the learning experience. We think that a music rhythm game is perfect for the job. Rhythm games typically require players to hit buttons in a specific order as seen on the screen, while following the beat of the music, which is fun for the players as they get to rock out to their favorite tunes, thus making rhythm games very popular. We see this as an opportunity to use the player’s enthusiasm toward learning ASL! Thus, we decided to add a twist to the rhythm games: instead of having players hit buttons, they will be waving sign ASL signs to the beat of the music!"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"CODA is a music rhythm game that teaches players American Sign Language (ASL) while having fun! Players will wave ASL signs to the lyrics of a song in front of a camera. Our game scores the players based on the accuracy of their waved hand signs as well as their adherence to the beat of the song."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Vision : the tracking model was based on a trained dataset from google’s mediapipe, which was trained on hands source from a variety of contexts. This allowed the dataset to recognize any pair of hands we tested on it. The data processing was completed using the opencv and numpy python libraries. Game : The user-facing aspect of our project was developed in Unity game engine. It offered a 2D game creation environment that allowed us to focus on creating a game that met our requirements and aesthetics. Graphics : The ASL signs were hand-drawn in Procreate from reference photos and then imported into Adobe Photoshop where they were colored, textured, and all-in-all “retrofied.” Elements were also animated in Photoshop through stop-motion frame rendering. Pixel icons were created in Piskel. The dynamic backgrounds of our songs were generated with Veed.io. UI/UX : We used figma to design our UI, which is retro desktop themed that matches the theme of HackGT 9. We also created a website where users could learn more about our game. In the future, we will include a link where our game can be directly downloaded from this website"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Lack of palm images dataset to train our machine learning algorithm to detect the hand signals. ASL signs had to be limited to stationary ones only, as the ability for our machine learning algorithm to differentiate between moving gestures was limited. Signs and lyrics had to be synchronized manually, which was a time-consuming and tedious process. It is hard to distinguish between certain hand signs, especially for a camera that doesn’t have any true depth perception"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We overcame the limited dataset challenge and developed an algorithm to accurately detect hand signals! We made nearly all of our game assets (logos/images/icons/UI elements) from scratch through a combination of hand-drawn images, vectors, and animations. Smooth, engaging gameplay with an attractive retro aesthetic."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"How to do UI/UX design with Figma How games and machine learning algorithms are made How to animate in Photoshop and Procreate Photoshop techniques for graphics design"},{"heading":"What's next for CODA","content":"Add more complicated songs to our song bank so that the user can learn more words in ASL.

One of the topics that came up was the challenge of proving non-physical abuse in front of a court of law. According to the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, 1 in 20 people experience physical abuse every minute in the United States (\"Statistics\", n.d.). However, abuse comes in many forms — whether physically, verbally or emotionally. Thus, 50% of abusive incidents go unreported as many victims believe that they could never prove their case, especially when the abuse is non-physical (\"Data says domestic violence incidents are down\", 2021). We all find this to be extremely disheartening and wanted to come up with a way to help these victims get out of their difficult situations."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Two^Eleven uses the classic mobile game 2048 as a decoy for a system of discreet recording mechanisms, file storing, and emergency report to assist victims of domestic violence in documenting their situation. To the normal eye, the app looks and works like nothing more than a simple game to avoid suspicion, but holding onto the screen for 3 seconds will reveal a menu of different actions disguised onto the first row of the 2048 board. The user can subtly gesture to start an audio or video recording, to open the storage library, or to trigger emergency mode. In this state, the app will send an SOS message to the user’s chosen emergency contacts with the current location of the user and ask them to call local authorities to the location."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"This iOS Application was built on Xcode using Swift. We utilized the Twilio API for automatic text messaging when the emergency mode is triggered."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our team ran into some challenges while developing Two^Eleven, but that did not deter us from creating an effective, usable application. We had difficulties implementing Twilio and connecting it to any phone. This cloud communication platform is essential to our application because the victims of abuse need a way to discreetly report dangerous situations to the police and their emergency contacts. Another obstacle we faced was trying to store user media on the cloud. We attempted to implement Google Cloud, but we realized it was out of our scope of skills. We had to then focus on using iCloud to save media directly to the user’s account."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Since this is our first hackathon and we are all emerging participants, being able to see our project from ideation to executable was an absolute joy. We were proud that we were able to practice, adapt and learn new skills in our mission to create a solution to a problem we deem important for us to address. It was also really fun going around and letting people play the game on our phone, then revealing the twist — the gist, really — of our application. Their genuine reactions made us really proud of the hard work we’ve poured into this project the past 36 hours."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"As this is our first hackathon, we definitely learned a lot, firstly, about how to quickly put together a meaningful project with an executable. We had to swiftly adapt to changes on the go due to time constraints and technology malfunctions. This allowed us to be exposed to a variety of technology as we continuously look for tools to improve our app’s functionalities. Through this process, we got to learn about Google Cloud’s, Apple CloudKit’s and Twilio’s technologies even though we couldn’t incorporate them all into our project within the time constraints. Teamwork is also an invaluable lesson we got from this project. We were all cognizant of communications but mishaps are bound to happen. We also run into disagreement fairly often, but have collectively learned to be comfortable enough to voice our own disaccords while keeping our minds open to other teammate’s ideas. We came to understand it is not the harmony in opinions but a good blend of differing ideas that pushes our product to a higher level. Above all, we learned to respect and uplift each other as friends and teammates in a flourishing way, so that we could all proudly say that Two^Eleven is the fruit of our collective labor."},{"heading":"What's next for Two^Eleven","content":"Two^Eleven’s security element can be improved to lower the chance of data being erased by the abuser or a third person. This can be done by hosting the data elsewhere like on Google Cloud Storage where it can be restricted to not be deleted before a certain length of time and ensures that even in the case where the device is destroyed or revoked, the data remains intact. We also want to implement a backup option where, when entered into emergency mode, all data gathered in the app will be compiled and emailed to a person of the user’s choice before wiping itself out entirely."},{"heading":"Citations","content":"Statistics.

This name is then queried using our python backend, which pulls nutrition data from Nutritionix (a nutrition API). Our backend then takes the raw nutrition data and cleans it to obtain the specific values and formatting we want. In our use case, the user's health goals are scraped from their MyFitnessPal account: a separate service that allows users to input health goals and receive daily macronutrient and micronutrient recommendations. Finally, we determine to what percentage the chosen food item will fulfill the user's goals, which is displayed in easy to read charts on our extension."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Initially, we had difficulty scraping data from the Instacart website through our extension and cleaning it to obtain just the name of the product and nutrition info if available. We had to experiment with different ways of identifying the needed data, so that our extension could work on any product at any store. We also had trouble connecting the output data of our python functions (which stored the nutrition information from the Nutritionix API) and our chrome extension. We solved this by creating an intermediary API that the chrome extension could call locally, which would then pull needed data from the Nutritionix and MyFitnessPal APIs."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud that we were able to tackle a need that we and many of our friends have had while food shopping. Meeting macronutrients and staying on top of health goals is something that is very important to us and our network, which is why we are so passionate about this product. We're also proud that we were able to make the extension responsive enough to work quickly for whichever product the user is browsing."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned that finding the right API and right tools is essential. Some APIs like MyFitnessPal API are private-access only, so we were forced to find our data in a different manner. We also wasted some time on Kroger's API by obtaining authorization, validating our access tokens, etc. when Kroger's API was not the best tool for our use case in the first place. Now we know to focus more on ideation and design before we begin solving issues that do not need to be solved."},{"heading":"What's next for Instahealth","content":"Instahealth has several directions for growth that we have brainstormed. Our first step for expanding the chrome extension is to enable it on other popular grocery/food shopping websites such as Walmart, Amazon Fresh, Kroger, Publix, etc. A feature we would add is price optimization. We want our users to be financially healthy as well! This additional feature would allow users to view if the product they are browsing is cost-efficient compared to other products that satisfy similar nutritional goals. We can also suggest better products that satisfy similar goals if the current product is not price-efficient."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"chart.js flask html5 javascript jquery json myfitnesspal-api nutrionix-api python requests"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.gatech.edu"}]},{"project_title":"ARcade","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/arcade-wky4cj","tagline":"ARcade pays homage to Retro Reset by using Augmented Reality to reimagine classic Pong.

It makes use of multi-peer connectivity , a rather new approach to host multiple participants in the same network to join the same game. The game initializes once the host player’s phone camera scans a flat surface suitable to host the Augmented Reality platform. Once a suitable surface is found, a second player wanting to play against the host can join the game using the app on their own phone. Upon initialisation, the game plays very similarly to classic pong, with each player’s objective being to prevent the ball from crossing their end of the table using pong paddles. Every time the ball crosses either end of the table, the player on the opposite side receives a point."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"To support a peer-to-peer application, we sought help from the detailed Apple Developer Docs and came across MultipeerConnectivity , a powerful package that allows for the creation of shared P2P experiences. On the more technical end, we integrated this package with ARWorldConfiguration() of ARKit so that devices nearby could all share one configuration, and add entities and anchors to the same ARSession. We kept track of the camera position and syncronized the paddle positioning with the respective device."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Building a game in AR is not that hard, but creating a multiplayer real-time game against two users on the same network is ground-breaking. Our biggest challenge was implementing multi-peer connectivity such that two users can compete against each other simultaneously in real-time on the same domain.\n\nScenekit vs Realitykit Our first big decision was to decide which ARKit framework to use, SceneKit or RealityKit? Although SceneKit has been around for a while and has much more support, we chose to go with RealityKit as it allows for better in-game physics and makes the multiplayer P2P connection instantaneous and real-time! Surface calibration - AR One of the largest starting hurdles was detecting and keeping track of planes in AR. To place our game table, we first had to map out a plane based on what the phone camera sees. But what was even harder was to deploy and fixate other objects and movable entities onto this table we just created, so that our puck and striker are always confined to the game board. We achieved this by treating every plane as an individual Node instead of a plane, and then constraining further smaller nodes like the puck to the TableNode so that it would never exceed the bounds of the tableNode."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our main goal was to expand our individual technical skill-sets. In a short span of time, we managed to learn the fundamentals of Swift and ARkit and other required frameworks and tools. Considering the complexity of our project and the ground-breaking development in the world of AR with the introduction of multi-peer connectivity, we are particularly proud of accomplishing our tasks under a time crunch and creating a one of a kind real-time multiplayer AR game. Coming from diverse academic backgrounds, ranging from Computer Science, Chemical Engineering and Mathematics forced us to adapt to varied skill-levels and perspectives despite which, we were able to collaborate efficiently."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Our biggest takeaway was the technical skills we gathered over the past 36 hours. With some of us with no coding background to others with rudimentary experience in mobile app development, we were able to broaden our technical skillset and are now proficient in working with Swift, Realitykit, and ARkit in general. We also understood that delegating tasks based on our individual skill levels was beneficial and most efficient, and our unique time management and scrum techniques paid off! Lastly, dealing with complex algorithms using core Physics and Linear Algebra taught us how to be patient, and the errors we ran into along the way taught us how to persevere through and improved our problem solving skills."},{"heading":"What's next for ARcade","content":"Our focus during the course of this hackathon was limited to developing a functional application to allow the user to compete with their friend on the same network in a quick game of Pong.

Systems like DALL-E 2 that produce artwork from user-given text prompts intrigued us and we wanted to explore the potential of this kind of AI in our project. Since we were all music lovers, we decided to try converting song lyrics into text and passing them into a text-to-image AI model to create art based on the lyrics. Upon researching the subject, ambition took over - we decided to take our project a step further and create entire music videos by blending together the AI-generated artwork. The name reverie34 came about because our project essentially converts a mp3 to a mp4, using AI to create dream-like (hence “reverie”) visuals to accompany the audio."},{"heading":"What it does:","content":"Our program uses natural language processing and image interpolation AI to convert spoken audio into a video that reflects what was said.

After passing these text segments into Deforum Stable Diffusion, a text-to-image diffusion model, images are generated based on the segments and image interpolation is performed to create a video. After putting the text on the video and combining it with the original audio, it is delivered back to the front end, where the user can view and download the final product."},{"heading":"Challenges:","content":"Each of us on the team took over different tasks for this project, including making the front end of the web application, creating the server for the back end, using Python for speech-to-text conversion and image diffusion, and much more. Our individual challenges mainly consisted of figuring out how to use the various AIs to do what we needed, particularly combining the functions of the speech-to-text and the text-to-image-to-video AI models to effectively create a speech-to-video generator. Since text-to-video conversion doesn’t quite exist publicly yet, our project topic delved into very new territory and that resulted in a lot of difficulties since we didn’t have many examples or tutorials to help guide us. Additionally, we came across a hardware challenge when some of the AI packages we wanted to use for text-to-image required more VRAM than we had on our laptops. For example, setting up Stable Diffusion was a struggle since it required a large amount of VRAM to run the AI. Fortunately, one of our team members was able to make use of the extremely powerful GPU in his PC so we could use Stable Diffusion and make progress on the project."},{"heading":"Accomplishments:","content":"This project was not easy or simply by any means. When we first suggested the idea, it was so daunting that we almost dismissed it, thinking there was no way we could accomplish it in 36 hours. Nobody in our group had any prior experience working with natural language processing AI systems, let alone text-to-image/video conversion AI. We’d all be breaking new ground if we attempted this project. But at the end of the day, curiosity and ambition won out. Here at the end, we are all extremely proud of how far we’ve come and what we’ve managed to scrape together in the last day and a half. Tackling this massive challenge and pulling through to create a working application has definitely been one of the best learning experiences our team has ever had."},{"heading":"What we learned:","content":"We’ve all learned quite a bit about the newly developing field of text-to-image/video conversion and some things about natural language processing as well. In addition, we all got to see firsthand how the hardware you use can greatly affect the extent of your coding power. But besides the technical skills we gained, we learned a lot about how to work well in a team and communicate our ideas.

All you need to play is a single laptop with a camera. The program uses ml5.js to detect key joints on your body, thereby marking your position relative to your opponent and scaled to your distance from the camera. You will be given a series of cutouts or “holes” on the screen to match your body position to. For each cutout, the computer will calculate your score based on how close your body is to the virtual “hole”. After 10 poses, a round ends and you’ll be given pictures of what you looked like when trying to match each of the 10 poses."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Since we wanted to make the game as accessible as possible, we decided to create a web app able to run on ordinary hardware. The project was programmed using javascript and various lightweight javascript libraries. The initial home screens were built with html, css, and javascript. The game itself was programmed using ml5.js, a machine learning library built on PoseNet to find a person’s body position in a video frame. We used p5.js to render the live camera feed, cutouts, pose mappings, and UI elements. All the computation is done locally in realtime on the computer using the vector normalized cutout position compared to the player’s actual position. The cutouts are randomly created in the “wall” and are randomly positioned on the screen to make you move to receive your well-earned points. Points for each of the 10 cutouts are summed together to calculate your final score."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"While generating holes in the “wall”, we tried to position them slightly away from the users to increase the difficulty.

We are in the process of adding an online version where you can play with friends even when you’re not in the same place as them (barring Chrome’s security measures).

We gutted the old electronics of the case, and instead fitted an op amp, full-wave rectifier, and Arduino Nano. The voltage (audio) connects to the op amp which amplifies it by a factor by 100 (power gain of 4.5V). It is given a smoothing rectifier with a significant capacitor, which essentially converts AC voltage to DC voltage. This was done to make programming a task of reading HIGH and LOW. Connect the rectifier’s output to the analog pin (A0) on the Arduino Nano. Conditional statements are used to determine if voltage is high, which indicates that the player is playing the guitar. If so, a “totalTime” variable is incremented accordingly. No time will be added if the input is LOW, meaning the player is not playing.\n\nAnother conditional is used to control the servo. If the totalTime is above a certain number (e.g. 25 minutes), the servo is activated, allowing candy to fall and reward the player. After rewarding the player, the LCD screen on the box displays a congratulations message to the player and the Arduino stops counting time."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Main challenges:\n\nNone of our group members had a guitar on campus, so getting a guitar for testing was very difficult. Fortunately, someone at the Hive allowed us to test for a few hours, but we could not take it with us after the Hive closed. We worked non-stop at Hive, from opening to closing. However, we were still limited by time. 20 minutes before the Hive closed, we ran into a bug with the op-amp circuit. Without the oscilloscopes, guitar, soldering irons, and other tools found at the Hive, we were unable to continue progress with the analog circuits. We tested the op-amp circuit multiple times - and it worked every time except right until the Hive was about to close. We asked for help and debugged until the Hive closed, but we couldn’t solve the problem in time. Thus, we had to adapt to an unfortunate fate and scrap the rectifier and op-amp, even though we spent a lot of time building it. Because of this, we had to changeWe still have the circuits and videos of them working for evidence. We overestimated the laser cutter’s accuracy. It was unreliable because the leveling was not ideal, thus causing problems for sections requiring high-precision, like small holes.\n\nOther challenges:\n\nNoise issues with the oscilloscopes. The Hive is very noisy when it comes to electrical signals. This buffered our efficiency in general. Strange communication error with the Arduino serial monitor and the limitation of cycles in PCs. We thought the Arduino wasn’t working, but it was. More or less, a challenge with all of us using Arduino Nano for the first time. Arduino misleading API for millis(), which is said to measure how much time occurred since the program started. It did not actually do this, so we had to use another library.

The project was a web-based application with an easy-to-use UI. Navigating around the homepage led to four different models — each helping in a different field of activity. We knew that integrating a camera based model into a web page might have several tedious nuances to it; however, we figured our big tech brains were enough to handle a couple hours of brutally exhausting debugging. And, so, we went ahead with it anyway with the “We’ll deal with it when it faces us!” attitude.\n\nEarly on after the hacking commenced, we decided to split the work into three rough parts: Jahnavi and Sai were to handle everything related to the workings of the OpenCV models, Jeet was to handle everything related to the front-end and the webpage, and Ujjwal handled integrating the OpenCV script (Made in Python) into the WebPage using Flask."},{"heading":"⏳ Challenges we ran into","content":"Ten hours in, although we weren’t making progress as fast as we would’ve liked, we still hadn’t hit a problem we couldn’t just StackOverflow our way out of. So, everything was a green flag for now. A couple hours of coding later, Ujjwal informed us about what became the bane of all our existences: Lag. You see, Flask is a fairly heavy python based framework; which is why when you implement an already heavy model to a webpage on a localhost, it leads to extreme lag. At one point, Ujjwal hit one of the virtual drums, and it took more than five seconds for the webcam feed to reload. Which is why we were left with no choice but to scrap using Flask as a whole and switch to a completely different framework. We tried substituting Flask with other python based frameworks like Django and Pyramid; however, while they solved the lag issue, they came with their own list of problems. Perplexed, we stared at a blank wall for the next twenty minutes— just thinking. Just when things started to look bleak, Jahnavi’s face cheered up like a beacon of hope peaking through a dusky, starry night. “Have you guys heard of Streamlit?” she asked. Streamlit is an open-source python based framework, and it works wonders when the task has something to do with embedding a script onto a webpage. However, since its a farly obscure technology, none of us had any experience working with it, which led all of us to learn an entirely new technology in the span of an hour."},{"heading":"🧠 What we learned","content":"A few hours into development, we learned that research on CV and ML models such as pose detection discount the hundreds of problems a developer needs to overcome to actually implement them in a full stack application. When Flask did not work as intended, we learned to adapt, learn a new techstacks on the fly and move to Streamlit. Having a team with diverse skills and experiences helped us perform at our best efficiency."},{"heading":"👷‍♂️ What's next for Passioneer","content":"We plan on adding several more hobbies for users to try out and tuning our models to support object detection in more challenging backgrounds to improve the overall function of our project.

They can practice in Guided Mode, where the letter prompt is accompanied with an illustration of the corresponding sign, or the more challenging Unguided Mode, where the illustration is not provided.\n\nWriting Mode\n\nMuch like how text-to-speech applications make texting easier for everyday users, our app's writing mode allows adept signers to quickly convert their signs into words and phrases, making written communication easier and more efficient."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our site is designed using the Flask web framework and React JavaScript library. It can be broken down into three main components: backend, server, frontend.\n\nBackend\n\nOur CV algorithm is written in Python and is built on top of Google's MediaPipe Hand Detection model. When provided with an input image, MediaPipe outputs coordinates for each of the 21 joints in the human hand, which we then normalize about the origin. Our first step consisted of creating a dataset consisting of about 200 of these representations per letter. We then input the completed dataset into a KNN grouping algorithm, which provided us a model with which to classify future 21-point representations of the human hand.\n\nServer\n\nOur Flask server handles communication between our Python backend and our React frontend. When the program is run, we wrap our CV code into a single function, gen_frames, which constantly yields a byte representation of the user's webcam with appropriate annotations. These images are easily imported into html files by accessing the endpoint {server_ip}:5000/video_feed . A similar process is used to pass sign illustrations and their corresponding letters into the Practice Mode dashboard. In order to notify our backend if a user decides to switch between Unguided and Guided Mode while practicing, we use a simple system of POST requests with appropriate event handlers.\n\nFrontend\n\nOur React UI is carefully planned to be as easy to use as possible through thoughtful CSS templating and website layout. Beyond appearances, we use the React library for all of our website's dynamic functionality, such as buttons to navigate between pages. Additionally, React is used to set up event handling for server communication."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Each of our app's three major components involved significant struggles throughout development.\n\nBackend\n\nOur biggest struggle was our model's accuracy. To improve the model itself, we experimented with different normalization techniques on our dataset, scaling datapoints nonlinearly to overrepresent small differences in joint locations between similar signs. We also introduced a requirement for a letter to be detected five times in a row before accepting it as a trustworthy output. Under these changes, our model is significantly more efficient.\n\nServer\n\nOur biggest struggle was handling communication between the backend/server and our React frontend. We experimented with websockets but found that they were two difficult to implement in our given timeframe. Instead, we eventually figured out how to use Flask Response objects and POST requests, which in the aggregate provided the same two-way communication functionality of a websocket.\n\nFrontend\n\nOur biggest challenge was determining the best way to present our model to create a pleasant user experience. The most challenging aspect of the functionality was the implementation of two practice modes and dynamic images, which we resolved through communication between the front and back ends. We experimented with different organizational structures and colors to create a bright, inviting feel to engage and motivate the user to learn."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are especially proud of our sign detection functionality. Though MediaPipe provided data about a hand's orientation, it was our idea to utilize a KNN to find patterns within this data and as a result, we were able to create a relatively homegrown algorithm. We are also proud of how we were able to overcome our challenges with websockets. Though websockets were the simplest solution if done correctly, we were able to improvise a solution involving two disparate techniques once it became clear that we were running out of time. We are also very proud of our ability to combine Flask and React capabilities into a single project, as it showcased our adaptability as problem solvers. Neither of us had ever done something like this before, but despite overwhelming errors and misunderstandings of documentation, we eventually pieced it together."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Through our struggles, we learned a lot about different machine learning techniques to improve accuracy, specifically the importance of data preprocessing. Additionally, we learned how to effectively integrate Flask and React into a single application. This will be extremely useful for future hackathons involving app development."},{"heading":"What's next for Giving a Hand","content":"We hope to further improve our CV algorithm, as it could be more accurate than it is right now. Additionally, our sign language alphabet is missing the letters Z and J because signing them requires hand movement, a variable that our KNN strategy is not equipped to handle.

Rachel Calder, a MS student in Bioinformatics was curious about how pervasive this issue was within the healthcare field, and discovered a need for subsects of the medical field where physician efficiency is crucial (Kannampallil et al 2018).\n\nThe team was inspired to create a tool to reduce the time healthcare professionals (HPs) spend on electronic health records (EHR). The project used Kewal's front-end skills, Rachel's health data science skills, and the back-end skills of Computer Science undergraduate students Hailey Ho and Gyandeep Reddy Vulupala. The project was named CareA11y to combine the concepts of improving the efficiency of patient's understanding of care while following standard accessibility (a11y) practices during development.

For any given doctor visits, there are 3 different translated notes - general/summary visit notes, procedures, and diagnoses. The HPs can review the text for accuracy before approving it for the patient to view. To enrich our translation dataset, the HPs can also add in their own technical-to-layman value pairs.

We chose to host our code online to make it easier and more flexible to utilize CRUD and other processing APIs in the front end service. We ran into numerous issues:\n\nWe had to explore and configure API clients for both AWS Comprehend Medicine API and Google Cloud Healthcare Natural Language API to evaluate their accuracy. The deployment required the use of git where two remote repositories were managed at the same time (i.e., GitHub and the cloud platform). The git references were hard to navigate.

In order to do this, a network of APIs and databases would have to replace certain static files."},{"heading":"What's next for Tula","content":"We hope to implement a full CI/CD pipeline and utilize web-hosted databases in order to allow the web app to respond with data accurately to whatever day queries are made."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"angular.js python pytorch"}]},{"project_title":"Life Pro-TECH-tor","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/life-pro-tech-tor","tagline":"Tech Saves Lives - We have created an application to help in unsafe or uncomfortable situations with a potential malicious intent.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/267/197/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 9","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt-9.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Domain Name from Domain.com"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"google-web-speech-api","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/ebhechmer/HackGT9"},{"label":"lifesaved.tech","url":"https://lifesaved.tech"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Beings students on a college campus, we have experienced and know of many situations in which we have felt uncomfortable being around another person. This issue is widespread all across the globe, most prominently showing itself in metropolitan areas. One very well known matter is that women can never feel safe walking alone, especially at night. We are hoping to solve this issue with our project."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our project allows any person to feel more safe when being engaged in conversation with another individual or traveling alone during any time of day. We have created a website that allows you to enter a \"safe word\" that, when spoken, will alert emergency services of your location as well as your situation. The user is able to choose the amount of times the safe word must be heard before alerting someone, and this is all achieved through the use of a constant audio monitoring once the user hits record. The most important reasoning for us building this is to allow someone to reach help without actively, and obviously, having to take out a device to contact these services."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"To build our project, we utilized Google Cloud's Speech-To-Text API, a combination of Flask and React, as well as Python, Javascript, HTML, and CSS. We were able to create the algorithm to detect the \"safe word\" using iterators and general control flow with Python calling to the API. The front-end is fully React with the input given from the user being sent to the back-end, and vice-versa with the results from the speech-recognition."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"When creating this project, we ran into many different challenges.

Each one of us were able to experiment in a new field that we weren't previously comfortable with, which was a great learning experience. Us finally being able to bring the front-end with React with the back-end with Flask was a huge, small, accomplishment for us as we had not really attempted this before on our own."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned that we have a lot to improve on when it comes to programming and next time we will be much more prepared!

We believe that if there was a mobile application, it would enable this idea to become bigger and better, hopefully reaching an audience that could lead to lives being saved. We would also love to implement a database that holds a user's last 1 minute of conversation so if the \"safe word\" is detected, it will be able to send the conversation to emergency services for context of the situation."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"flask google-cloud google-web-speech-api python react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com lifesaved.tech"}]},{"project_title":"Volatility Viewer","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/volatility-viewer","tagline":"Educating investors on evolving market volatility and conditions.
