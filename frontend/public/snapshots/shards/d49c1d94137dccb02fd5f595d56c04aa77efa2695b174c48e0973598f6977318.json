It provides a unique blend of functionality for an expert developer and ease of use for those who are still learning. ENNUI visualizes and allows for modification of neural network architectures. Users are able to construct any (non-recurrent) architecture they please.\n\nWe take care of input shapes and sizes by automatically flattening and concatenating inputs where necessary. Furthermore, it provides full access to the underlying implementation in Python / Keras. Neural network training is tracked in real time and can be performed both locally and on the cloud."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We wrote a Javascript frontend with an elegant drag and drop interface.

This is largely because, for obvious reasons, we cannot bring in actual weapons. Up close however, we have consistent identification of team member items.\n\nUsing our current server set up, we consistently get server overload errors. So we have an extended delay between each image send. Given time, we would implement an actual camera network, and also modify our system so that it would perform object recognition on videos as opposed to basic pictures. This would improve our accuracy. Web sockets can be used to display the data collected in real time."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we’re proud of","content":"1) It works!!!

We could also use more machine learning models to predict where the threat is going and distinguish between threats and police officers. The system can be made more robust by causing the app to update in real time. Finally, we would add the ability to use law enforcement emergency alert infrastructure to alert people in the area of shooter location in real time.

She survived with a few cuts and bruises, but unfortunately, there are many victims who are not as lucky. The emotional and physical trauma she and other drunk-driving victims experienced motivated us to try and create a solution in the problem space.\n\nOur team initially started brainstorming ideas to help victims of car accidents contact first response teams faster, but then we thought, what if we could find an innovative way to reduce the amount of victims? How could we help victims by preventing them from being victims in the first place, and ensuring the safety of drivers themselves?\n\nDespite current preventative methods, alcohol-related accidents still persist. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in the United States, there is a death caused by motor vehicle crashes involving an alcohol-impaired driver every 50 minutes. The most common causes are rooted in failing to arrange for a designated driver, and drivers overestimating their sobriety. In order to combat these issues, we developed a hardware and software tool that can be integrated into motor vehicles.\n\nWe took inspiration from the theme “Hack for a Night out”. While we know this theme usually means making the night out a better time in terms of fun, we thought that another aspect of nights out that could be improved is getting everyone home safe. Its no fun at all if people end up getting tickets, injured, or worse after a fun night out, and we’re hoping that our app will make getting home a safer more secure journey."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"This tool saves lives.\n\nIt passively senses the alcohol levels in a vehicle using a gas sensor that can be embedded into a car’s wheel or seat. Using this data, it discerns whether or not the driver is fit to drive and notifies them. If they should not be driving, the app immediately connects the driver to alternative options of getting home such as Lyft, emergency contacts, and professional driving services, and sends out the driver’s location.\n\nThere are two thresholds from the sensor that are taken into account: no alcohol present and alcohol present. If there is no alcohol present, then the car functions normally. If there is alcohol present, the car immediately notifies the driver and provides the options listed above. Within the range between these two thresholds, our application uses car metrics and user data to determine whether the driver should pull over or not. In terms of user data, if the driver is under 21 based on configurations in the car such as teen mode, the app indicates that the driver should pull over. If the user is over 21, the app will notify if there is reckless driving detected, which is based on car speed, the presence of a seatbelt, and the brake pedal position."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Hardware Materials:\n\nArduino uno Wires Grove alcohol sensor HC-05 bluetooth module USB 2.0 b-a Hand sanitizer (ethyl alcohol)\n\nSoftware Materials:\n\nAndroid studio Arduino IDE General Motors Info3 API Lyft API FireBase"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Some of the biggest challenges we ran into involved Android Studio. Fundamentally, testing the app on an emulator limited our ability to test things, with emulator incompatibilities causing a lot of issues. Fundamental problems such as lack of bluetooth also hindered our ability to work and prevented testing of some of the core functionality. In order to test erratic driving behavior on a road, we wanted to track a driver’s ‘Yaw Rate’ and ‘Wheel Angle’, however, these parameters were not available to emulate on the Mock Vehicle simulator app. We also had issues picking up Android Studio for members of the team new to Android, as the software, while powerful, is not the easiest for beginners to learn. This led to a lot of time being used to spin up and just get familiar with the platform. Finally, we had several issues dealing with the hardware aspect of things, with the arduino platform being very finicky and often crashing due to various incompatible sensors, and sometimes just on its own regard."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We managed to get the core technical functionality of our project working, including a working alcohol air sensor, and the ability to pull low level information about the movement of the car to make an algorithmic decision as to how the driver was driving. We were also able to wirelessly link the data from the arduino platform onto the android application."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Learn to adapt quickly and don’t get stuck for too long Always have a backup plan"},{"heading":"What's next for Drink+Dryve","content":"Minimize hardware to create a compact design for the alcohol sensor, built to be placed inconspicuously on the steering wheel Testing on actual car to simulate real driving circumstances (under controlled conditions), to get parameter data like ‘Yaw Rate’ and ‘Wheel Angle’, test screen prompts on car display (emulator did not have this feature so we mimicked it on our phones), and connecting directly to the Bluetooth feature of the car (a separate apk would need to be side-loaded onto the car or some wi-fi connection would need to be created because the car functionality does not allow non-phone Bluetooth devices to be detected) Other features: Add direct payment using service such as Plaid, facial authentication; use Docusign to share incidents with a driver’s insurance company to review any incidents of erratic/drunk-driving Our key priority is making sure the driver is no longer in a compromising position to hurt other drivers and is no longer a danger to themselves. We want to integrate more mixed mobility options, such as designated driver services such as Dryver that would allow users to have more options to get home outside of just ride share services, and we would want to include a service such as Plaid to allow for driver payment information to be transmitted securely. We would also like to examine a driver’s behavior over a longer period of time, and collect relevant data to develop a machine learning model that would be able to indicate if the driver is drunk driving more accurately. Prior studies have shown that logistic regression, SVM, decision trees can be utilized to report drunk driving with 80% accuracy."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android-studio arduino"}]},{"project_title":"YeetView","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/yeetview","tagline":"An accessible Google StreetView for the visually impaired through visceral scene description built with Deep Learning","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/683/553/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackMIT 2018","hackathon_url":"https://hackmit-2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Place"},{"hackathon_name":"HackMIT 2018","hackathon_url":"https://hackmit-2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Spell API hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"deep-learning","url":null},{"name":"google-streetview","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-streetview"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"spell","url":null},{"name":"web-speech-api","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/mitchmcdee/yeetview"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/R0bk/image_captioning"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We drew inspiration from the theme of the weekend and decided to target out project about two things we are very passionate about.

This enabled real-time exploration and feedback from the environment.\n\nWe also used Spell to train our machine learning models. Since we hadn't used this platform before, and since it was significantly different to standard training pipelines, it took us considerable time to debug and construct a working pipeline. It's worth noting that by the end of the weekend we had gained back significant time by using Spell over standard methods."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We were able to successfully incorporate speech recognition, voice navigation, visceral scene description and speech synthesis in the space of 24 hours.

This might be okay for over-the-counter medicine like Tylenol, but for prescription medicines - especially those that offer critical, life-saving functionalities and must be taken on time - this is a large problem, one that is actually much more extensive than it seems at first glance. In most cases, a completed bottle of medication means the prescription must be renewed by the doctor even before a refill can be acquired from the pharmacy. Waiting lists for doctor’s appointments are extensive, often on the order of weeks, and many people have work schedules that conflict with the hours pharmacies are open to dispense medication - all presenting unnecessary hindrances to something as crucial as getting medicine.

Using either a Microsoft Azure based chatbot interface or a phone call connected to RevSpeech’s text-to-speech service, patients can identify the symptoms they are experiencing and either request review for a potential new prescription, or request a renewal of an existing prescription. This request is sent to doctors, who can securely authorize the document using DocuSign’s electronic signature toolkit. Next, this authorization is piped into Rigetti’s quantum computing platform, in which an entangled pair of quantum bits is generated as highly secure authorization tokens. One of the qubits is sent to an authentication server, while the other qubit is sent to the patient, along with a QR code representing the prescription. The patient can drive to an automated prescription dispensing machine, for which we have developed a prototype, and scan the QR code. This identifies the prescription and verifies its authenticity by running multiple reads on the qubit to ensure entanglement with the original reference generated for that prescription. A second layer of authentication is performed by verifying that the user's geographical location corresponds with that of the dispenser. Once integrity is confirmed, the user is prompted to collect their prescription and the medicine is dispensed."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We divided up each of the segments of this project (of which there were many) among our team members.

Something just as critical in both our every day lives and in moments of crisis: server space. The fact of the matter is that everything else we depend on, from emergency services apps to messenger systems, relies on server performance as a given. But the reality is that during storms, data centers go down all the time. This problem is exacerbated in remote areas of the world, where redirecting requests to regional data centers isn't an option.

So imagine charging your phone, enabling Nimbus, and allowing your locked phone to act as the server for a schoolchild in Indonesia during typhoon season. Where other distributed computation engines have failed, Nimbus excels. Rather than treating each node as equally suitable for a compute task, our scheduler algorithm takes into account all sorts of factors before assigning a task to a best node, like CPU and the time the user intends to spend idle (how long the user will be asleep, how long the user will be at an offline Facebook event). Users could get paid marginal compensation for each compute task, or Nimbus could come bundled into a larger app, like Facebook.\n\nNimbus Desktop, which we've proof-of-concepted in the Desktop branch of our Github repo, uses a central server to assign tasks to each computer-node via Vagrant Docker provisioning. We haven't completed this platform option, but it serves another important product case: enterprise clients. We did the math for you: a medium sized company running 22,000 ec2s on Nimbus Desktop on its idle computers for 14 hours a day could save $6 million / year in AWS fees. In this case, the number of possible attack vectors is minimized because all the requests would originate from within the organization. This is the future of computing because it's far more efficient and environmentally friendly than solely running centralized servers. Data centers are having an increasingly detrimental effect on global warming; Iceland is already feeling its effects. Nimbus Desktop offers a scalable and efficient future.
