It’s been theorized that LLMs could be useful to simulate human actions, and in particular, emergent behavior that occurs from humans engaging with each other, e.g., belief-formation, debate and deliberation, consensus and fragmentation. By tailoring prompts to each specific individual and having agents interact with each other, group dynamics for real individuals can be replicated.\n\nIf we could realistically simulate how people engage with online content and communities, we could both study social behavior and adapt our online behavior optimized based on test data (e.g., ad campaigns, product launches, political statements, board presentations). Simulations are preferable in cases where real-world testing carries: 1) low accuracy (e.g., focus groups for a potential ad campaign cannot capture the full spectrum of potential emergent responses from multi-agent online interaction), 2) reputational cost (e.g., testing whether AOC should run for president would probably get leaked if tested on real people), 3) economic cost (e.g., testing response to a new airplane design is expensive so simulating planes pre-build can save money), or 4) difficulty (e.g., testing presentations for a board meeting might not be possible, but a virtual board can respond to hundreds of iterations on a potential pitch).\n\nThe effectiveness of these simulations comes from being able to realistically mimic what an actual agent would do, based on all their past behavior. We use the example of a text-based online community (Twitter) with real user personas to demonstrate how LLMs can be used to create realistic multi-agent simulations."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We built agents to simulate real Twitter users based on their tweet, retweet, quote tweet, comment, and like history. Each user is an agent with their own specific prompt based on their past history (the 100K context window is quite useful here). Agents interact with each other and all the content they post, generating new tweets and new engagement based on how those users would actually behave according to past behavior. The interface also allowed for tweets to be added manually to see how the community responds.\n\nWe then test the responses of the community to various ad campaigns from brands, political statements from candidates, and social commentary from comedians.\n\nThis is a proof of concept for how anyone who engages with communities of other humans could use these simulations to predict engagement, responses, and behavior modification."},{"heading":"Use cases","content":"Ad campaigns: In Dec 2020, Peloton released an ad which featured a husband gifting his wife a Peloton for the holidays. The ad was negatively picked up up by communities on Twitter, who called it sexist, and Peloton stock dropped 10% ($1.5Bn) in just 3 days. This reaction was unanticipated by the marketing team at Peloton, and focus groups alone were not able to capture this backlash, leading to financial harm and stock volatility for Peloton. If instead they had been able to run hundreds of low-cost simulations, they could have identified that the gift made it seem like the husband was forcing his wife to lose weight, and instead could have tested potential tweaks (e.g., woman buys herself a Peloton). Large-scale simulations allow for visibility into edge cases and tail risks Social engagement: Brands and influencers can test how various posts will perform in terms of engagement beyond just predicting likes or response rates. They can assess the text of comments and analyze the granularities of how users respond (e.g., references, jokes that are likely to be made, if there will be any backlash), what accounts might be most likely to respond well, or analytics on content in responses. By having the language of potential responses, it can be deeply mined to optimized response across the full distribution of possible outcomes. Political research: Politicians or academics can test how consensus, debate, and deliberation would occur among real user populations. Candidates running for office can temperature check how their user base would respond to various tweets without risking their real follower base. They can also use this to shape what political positions might appeal to their constituents. Academics can study how deliberation and belief-formation occurs with richer custom datasets that allow for exploration across the spectrum of interaction types. Trust & safety: Social media platforms can test how different algorithmic decisions or content policies might influence behavior on the platform by testing out lots of simulations, especially where long-tail outcomes (e.g., CSAM, threats of violence, etc) are high-risk and high-impact to the company. Testing computationally before releasing changes ensures that the risks can be mitigated before public engagement can occur. Product launch / sales: Simulated users can be used to see risks in a product launch to the general population, or even to a specific group (e.g., in-house employees, external investors). If I want to know how my board might respond to a product launch, I can simulate the board meeting with agents for each member and analyze how the conversation flows. If I want to optimize my pitch to sell a big deal to a partner, I can test it out based on a virtual version of the people who will be in the meeting."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Twitter API has a rate limit of 1500 tweets/month -- so we did some reverse engineering to scrape it anyway :)"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Scraping Twitter by reverse-engineering their Android & iOS clients Claude-2 100K context window API, using custom prompts for each agent LangChain + LangSmith Vite + React + Typescript\n\nInspiration from Kevin Liu and Evan Mays"},{"heading":"Improvements","content":"Increase number of simulations Increase number of agents Increase complexity of each agent to get closer and closer to “true” reality Increase closeness of simulating real-life interaction process Multi-modal content to move beyond text-based online content"},{"heading":"The future","content":"Simulated users can be used to mimic the interactions of real-world group.

Researchers waste countless hours combing through papers just to find promising protein and molecule combinations to investigate. Once they finally identify potential candidates, they must run lengthy conventional simulations to determine if binding and other molecular interactions will be successful.\n\nThis problem is difficult to address with other language models because it requires a context window large enough to consider multiple literature sources and the ability to call many different functions. Truly solving it would also require incorporating the current state of the art from research institutions in protein folding and molecular simulations, which is often not accessible to biology researchers with limited software experience."},{"heading":"Our Solution","content":"ClaudeScholar is a tool, built with Oloren Orchestrator, that allows researchers to upload or search any context that is relevant to their research, and then interact with that information with a natural chat interface. Users can search through any document with natural language, uncover insights across multiple research papers, and even task the AI assistant with complicated workflows like generating new compounds and modeling protein interactions using state of the art research such as RFDiffusion.\n\nClaude 2’s large context window allows us to achieve this with sufficient context, and also requires little effort from the researcher to trigger agent actions. Our system prompt allows Claude to interpret when a user’s prompt matches an available function, and we designed ClaudeScholar to be able to support new actions easily.\n\nIn summary, ClaudeScholar lets you:\n\nUpload relevant research, PDB files, and other content for Claude to use as context Search for authoritative context through PubMed Query, Summarize, and Synthesize information across your content Visualize proteins Generate new molecules that can bind to a given protein using RFDiffusion Convert PDF to Text instantly Find similar molecules and add them to the conversation And a lot more!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Github: https://github.com/sauhaardac/bioclaude"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into and what we learned from them","content":"Adding diffdock was a huge challenge, we spent hours managing dependencies.

We initially had trouble with hallucinations, but we were able to solve this both by giving the LLM tools in XML format and by incorporating documents and summaries into our model. We found it difficult to prompt the model to call functions initially, but the talk on the prompting workshop gave us great advice on how to prompt with XML that helped greatly."},{"heading":"What's next for ClaudeScholar","content":"With a few improvements we really believe that this could be a useful tool for biology researchers.
