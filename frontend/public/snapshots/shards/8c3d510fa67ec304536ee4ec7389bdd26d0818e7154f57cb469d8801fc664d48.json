We are a group of anime fans who dreamed of anime characters coming to real life since our childhood. In the past 3 days, we made our dreams come true. Our AR battle simulator projects hologram on our favourite anime characters to bring them to life. We achieved two main goals: projecting hologram to bring our anime protagonist to live; casting Japanese ninjutsu in hologram form through ML Hand Sign Recognition. These used to be only items that exists in anime classics such as Naruto (an anime about Japanese Ninjas) , Yugioh (an anime about a card game that can summon virtual/real monsters), but today we brought them from the 2D display to the 3D world. A small step for 4 anime fans, a giant leap for the anime community. In addition, the anime industry is a huge untapped market in the west. According to Hollywoodreport, the revenue of the anime industry in 2017 was 19.1 billion USD. The industry is full of figure collectors that are more than willing to pay for innovative anime merchandise. Not only is our project a major breakthrough for the anime community, it is also potentially extremely profitable."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The battle simulator is a game where two players brawl off in the battle of Naruto ninjutsu hand signs. Each player has an anime figure. When ninjutsu is cast, the effect is projected on the anime figure as a hologram. The machine learning model can identify 12 unique hang signs from the anime Naruto and different anime cards. Each ninjutsu consists of multiple hand signs.\n\nHologram demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wP-MFGF_UKBkN2Uv-KxRyxEyveSBHZ3z/view?usp=sharing\n\nHand sign demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PSYILYJyG9ejJosRWk2ShaHvN29rtybN/view?usp=sharing\n\nFull live demo: https://drive.google.com/file/d/178inYQhvB55_E9wC00r53HRkvtmSWTgP/view?usp=sharing"},{"heading":"How WE built it","content":"We constructed the battle dome and hologram projector using cardboards, coloured paper, and monitor display. We build the machine learning model using Keras and tensorflow. We trained the model with custom dataset with 15k images gathered during the hackathon (it took a long time). At the same time, we also worked on creating a front and backend connection to host the animations and hold the game logic. We utilized flask for the backend and used react for the frontend."},{"heading":"Challenges WE ran into","content":"With flask being single threaded (python in general) it was difficult for us to maintain or plan for multiple thread usages, something node would do great. However, tensorflow and keras has such a great python community that we chose to stick with it."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that WE are proud of","content":"We set out a grand vision at the beginning of Hack the North to build a hologram AI battle dome. The objective was difficult and grand in nature; however, we were able to achieve it in the end. It is more than a minimum viable product, it represents the hard work and the constant trial and error during the 36 hours of Hack the North."},{"heading":"What WE learned","content":"We learned to decrease the scope of the project when time and resource constraints are major issues. Machine learning, text to speech, web development, and hologram. Needless to say, we were ambitious. It is as if we are building 4 projects side by side instead of one. We learned that to achieve this grand vision, we had to decrease the scope of the project and use helpful APIs to do different components. We decreased the number of consecutive hand signs from 5 to 2; we used an API called Voice Flow to build the voice controller instead of building it from scratch. All of these discussions helped us to achieve our end goal."},{"heading":"What's next for AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle Simulator","content":"The next step for the AR Voice Control and ML Hand Sign Ninjutsu Battle Simulator is to build a version of it that works for a smartphone.

This often leads to fragmented thoughts captured in the form of unorganized blurbs of text. Unfortunately, having to pay attention to the information being put forward in a lecture comes at the cost of assimilating the information in the notes. Simply in order to assist us in our daily lives, we built an application that allows us to focus on learning (while taking terrible notes) by taking away the need to constantly format the way we write. We can stay disorganized (as long as all relevant information is transcribed) and simply allow the application to generate high-quality, readable and concisely formatted notes."},{"heading":"The problem we saw","content":"Sagacity was developed to counter a daily issue that students face — note-taking. As the standards for education around the world continuously rise, the difficulty of notetaking does as well. Students are fed more information, at a faster rate than ever before. Rather than valuing the quality of their notes, students are forced to write rudimentary and fragmented notes in order to keep up with the fast pace of modern-day education. Thus, the students are forced to either make quick, scribbled notes to keep up, or make higher quality notes and fall behind."},{"heading":"What exactly does it do?","content":"Sagacity is a web-based application that streamlines the note-taking process by digitizing disorganized hand-written notes by turning them into clearly formatted and structure notes. We use state-of-the-art OCR and NLP technologies in order to translate the handwriting to text and generate text around the keyword and related sentences found within the document."},{"heading":"Who is it intended for?","content":"High school and post-secondary students are the target audience for this service. Whether they wish to simply organize their notes digitally, clean up cryptic notes to allow for easier comprehension, or anything in-between."},{"heading":"How it was built","content":"This application used text detection models from the Google Cloud Platform as well as robust OCR to convert the handwriting in the image into text. All of the extracted data/metadata is put into a data structure that resembles a tree (slightly more complicated implementation, but we won't go into it here) after which all the detected text is put into a state-of-the-art NLP model (uses new recurrent network architectures as well as unsupervised learning) used to generate text around the key phrases while accounting for related sentences ."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css google-cloud-vision html javascript mongodb natural-language-processing node.js python tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Complete","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/complete-complete-your-code-with-others-ideas","tagline":"Complete: your code with other's ideas","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/844/024/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2019","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2019 Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css3","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3"},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"selenium","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/selenium"},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/curtischong/htn2019-client"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Before I solve my complicated calculus assignment, I go through examples.

All the user has to do is type out a comment with what he/she wants the code to do and we interpret the meaning and insert a code snippet that should connect into the flow of the code with minor changes."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used typescript, HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create an appealing front end that is intuitive and convenient to use for long periods of time.\n\nOur searching algorithm - We use TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to weight keywords in highlighted snippets and process only the important keywords while searching. We use the Search code API to parse the web and get actual code snippets. We then run the results from through Difflib, a difference comparator, to get the most similar and relevant snippets.\n\nSemantic Search- We process users comments (that start with '@s') and run it on GitHub's Semantic search and use selenium to scrape the data."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Processing large chunks of code into a few meaningful keywords was by far the hardest challenge.

We love going to hackathons, using new tech, and combining it all together to build something cool. Oftentimes, we're building with open source software: React, Express.js, Tensorflow, you name it.\n\nUnfortunately, these (and any other open source project) have bugs and feature requests that end up piling onto the repo page, with many buried, never to be fixed. Encountering these issues is already super inconvenient for hackers like us, but imagine the headache caused for companies using the open source platform in production. As much as we all love software, very few developers use their precious time to contribute to open source - especially to fix issues that they themselves aren't personally facing.\n\nThis is why we created AlgoFund (a pun on \"I'll go fund\"), a decentralized bounties platform that allows anyone to attach a bounty to any GitHub issue - giving a reward to the developer who successfully solves and merges a solution."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"AlgoFund is a fully featured bounties platform.

Our team was inspired to take on a challenge that would improve the lives of those around us while remaining true to our roots. When the Fort McMurray fires of 2016 destroyed over 3244 homes and caused 9.9 billion USD in damages, the lives of our team members were transformed. Coming from Alberta, the effects of the fire left a lasting impression on our views of how technology can be used for good and helped us discover a newfound sense of purpose. We sought to use new and novel technologies to make this a reality. Guardian is a novel helmet designed to advance current firefighting methods. By attaching various crucial sensors on the helmet, we are able to gather important vitals about the environment such as temperature, CO2 levels, atmospheric pressure, volume of total organic compounds, and much more while simultaneously sending this data in real-time over the Internet of Things platform to a remote database. We then retrieved this information and created a unique web user interface that responded to the real-time changes in data to relay information across all individuals over watching the situation."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The Guardian firefighter helmet sends and retrieves information by using six sensors connected to a central microcontroller capable of connecting to nearby WiFi networks. When information from the environment is extracted, we are capable of sending this information using WiFi following the IOT protocol to a remote real-time database where it is stored and processed. When this information is retrieved, it is used to create a web user interface that displays the information in a real-time framework to show changes as they happen. This interface allows all subscribers to the web app to monitor the situation different firefighters are and providing assistance when needed."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"The microcontroller we used for this project is the NodeMCU board which is an Internet of Things enabled board built on top of the Arduino framework. We then attached several sensors to the board (DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor, CCS811 Air Quality Sensor, BME280 Atmospheric and Pressure Sensor, and VEML6070 UV Index Sensor) following the I2C (Inter-Integrated Circuit) protocol where we used a multi-master/multi-slave architecture to allow sensors to publish and receive data to the bus system. When the data is received by the NodeMCU microcontroller, the data is sent over WiFi to a real-time Google Firebase database where it is categorized by sensor and type of data. This information is then retrieved and displayed on a web app user interface updated in real-time. The web app is built using the Vue.js framework to process the real-time data. Other areas of the web app such as the front-end design are built using the HTML5, CSS3, and Javascript. Additional features were implemented using Bootstrap, and ApexGraphs."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Throughout the project, our team ran into several challenges regarding the hardware aspect of the implementation of the helmet. As this was our first time using the IOT framework, we found it difficult in the beginning to find a method of connecting to WiFi. When we initially tried to use an Arduino Uno board and connected an ESP8266 WiFi module to it, we found that the setup required to connect to Google Firebase required several external frameworks that we were unable to implement. As a result, we switched over to the NodeMCU board which had the ESP8266 WiFi chip already built into the board. However, since this is a much smaller microcontroller, the number of input and output data pins was half of that of the Arduino Uno. In order to counteract this, our team members learned to use the I2C protocol which allowed us to connect several sensors to only one bus and save the input and output pins."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"As a team, we overcame multiple challenges in order to produce a fully functional product. We were able to integrate both hardware and software into this project. On the hardware side, we implemented a total of six sensors: temperature, carbon dioxide concentration, total volatile organic compounds. We are very proud of connecting most sensors through the I2C protocol, making the product lighter and more portable. On the software side, we implemented real-time database using Google's FIrebase. By uploading real-time data collected from the sensors to the database and retrieving them to the web application, operators behind the screens will have an accurate picture of the fire scene. They will be able to make appropriate decisions to better exterminate the fire and possibly safe the lives of the firefighters."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"This project taught us the importance of communication protocols. Since we had team members working on the software side as well as team members working on the hardware side. It was crucial for us to establish a communication protocol early on in the project as it is difficult for both teams to work on the project simultaneously if the software team was not retrieving data from the hardware team. In order to overcome this, we made sure to establish a solid form of communication of data so the software team knew exactly how to fetch the data and what format it would be in. By doing this, as the hardware team was integrating more sensors, the software team was able to generate their own faux data following the same communication protocol before real data was provided. This made integrating the two sides of the project at the end very easy and efficient."},{"heading":"What's next for Guardian","content":"In the future, we plan on implementing a full master-slave protocol between the web app and the microcontroller. Currently, the microcontroller is capable of sending information to Google Firebase and the web app is capable or retrieving it, however, the opposite is not possible. Having the web app alert firefighters of unstable or dangerous conditions is crucial in the safety for all parties involved, as a result, in the future we will want to implement the ability for the web app to publish to Google Firebase as well and allow the microcontroller to retrieve this data and provide feedback to the user. For example, if one helmet detects a dramatic increase in CO2 gas, a notification will be able to the sent to all helmets after the data has been parsed and sent to the web app."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"apex-charts arduino bootstrap c c++ css3 firebase google-cloud hardware html5 i2c iot javascript vue.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Innovape","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/innovape","tagline":"A personalized solution to quitting smoking","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/840/714/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2019","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2019 Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"expo.io","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/expo-io"},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"juul","url":null},{"name":"react-native","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/xwinxu/Juul"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Juul has not only taken over the e-cigarette industry, but also people's lives.

We had to work around this issue with bitwise stencil operations.\n\nAnother challenge was the teleportation of the player when the player enters a portal.

Even worse, studies show that the average time you have before a doctor will interrupt you is 11 seconds !!! How much can you possibly explain in 11 seconds? Maybe one symptom you're having, but good luck trying to fit in your concern that your close friend recently had similar symptoms that escalated and resulted in an amputated arm. Or that you lost your job last month, don't have valid health insurance and can't afford even the cheapest medications. Or that, despite the best treatment plan being a combination of medications and minor surgery, this is against your culture that prioritizes spiritual and natural therapies.\n\nThe fault doesn't lie within the doctor necessarily, systematic healthcare constraints prevent the doctor from spending an extended amount of time with each patient. As a result, patients lose trust in their relationship with their doctor, adhere less to their treatment plan, and the doctor may also suggest options that aren't the most appropriate because they don't have a complete overview of the patient's presenting situation. But it wasn't always this way - medical students during training will spend ~1 hour with patients digging in to understand as much as they possibly could and gain a holistic view of the patients current symptoms, emotions, family history, social history, and more.\n\nFurthermore, problems such as non-adherence to treatment plans cost the healthcare system upwards of $300 billion.\n\nThe solution? Collecting the patient history prior to the visit rather than during the 11 seconds at the beginning . This needs to be done in a convenient and user friendly manner to maximize adoption by the general population while simultaneously generating an output that is short enough for the doctor to quickly glance over and hit the ground running at the beginning of each patient encounter. That's exactly where Historify comes in."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Historify is a conversation voice-user interface (VUI), white-labelled to the doctor/clinic and deployed via a smart speaker. Prior to a scheduled appointment, Historify will prompt the patient to interact with an intelligent series of questioning which collects their detailed history - significantly more than what can be obtained in 11 seconds. This interaction is conversational in nature as this has been shown to maximize patient engagement and develop an increased feeling of trust/openness. In addition, the questioning is reactive to the patient's responses and is broken into 2 parts.\n\nThe first part is a generic set of questions that applies to most conditions and includes the patients social/family history. The second component contains questions specific ONLY to the patient's current complaint. This is done by tapping into a library of medical conditions (with their associated symptoms, diagnosis, tests, etc.) and a logical tree that tries to distinguish between various medical diagnoses. This is reactive to the answers that are presented. Historify then takes all of this information and auto-generates a very simple patient history report that is sent to the physician to review for the appointment.\n\nImportantly, one of the major use cases for Historify is its ability to deploy in numerous languages. Language barriers are a huge barrier to quality healthcare, particularly in remote settings. By completing their history prior to a visit, even if the patient doesn't speak the doctors language well the report can be translated automatically or using a professional translator to ensure everyone receives the highest quality treatment plan."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our team's focus was on building an MVP that could drive a conversation with a patient, collect their history, and then generate a report that could be viewed externally by a doctor. We constructed several medical templates of all the pertinent information that is desirable to obtain when gathering a patient history and researched different medical conditions that can be associated with chest pain as a starting test.\n\nWe then used Voiceflow's platform to construct the conversational interface that would interact with a patient remotely, gather the required information and store it on google cloud. We then also designed a website to imitate what the doctor's screen might look like and pulled the data into a report."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Initially we were focusing on using certain technology and trying to force it into a solution which led us nowhere. We adapted and focused on discovering a problem that we were passionate about solving, which led us to the concept of collecting patient history. Prior to this, none of us had any experience designing conversational voice interfaces or using Voiceflow, so this was a completely new area for us to learn from scratch."},{"heading":"What's next for Historify","content":"We feel that Historify has a ton of potential to streamline many of the problems that healthcare currently faces related to time constraints. Stemming from the history collection, we can integrate existing APIs related to medical diagnosis or develop this ourselves and determine a confidence % for a potential diagnosis. Using this, we can actually have suggested tests for likely diagnoses available on the doctor's screen and pre-populated with patient info to improve efficiency.

To make our modern and professional looking website, HTML, CSS, and Javascript were used. Many drafts were made up of what we wanted novella to be far before we arrived at waterloo. The backend was programmed with Python. Our program uses OAuth2 to connect FreshBoooks users to novella and access intelligent accounting information based on their real financial information from FreshBook. To bring these two ends together, Novella uses flask."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Novella was a passion project that our team had been planning out for quite some time. We planned out the design and what features we wanted to offer users but at times we were unsure of how we would be able to complete our goals. However, our core value for our hack was to help passionate people grow if they are willing to put in the work, quite similar the hackathon we had been working hard to prepare for. We had a plan and we researched on how to accomplish these goals. However, even with our thorough planning, many parts of this project were completely new to us and proved to be challenging. 2/3 of our team had never worked with web APIs before and were unsure of what we would be doing. Would we be modifying FreshBooks website or making our own? How to do we get all the information we need to see novella be the resource we wanted it to be? And what the heck is OAuth2 and why was it so hard?! Nobody in our group had ever worked with API authentication so understanding how it worked and what we needed to do to get the information we were looking for was a huge hurtle for the backend team. Nearly half of the time allotted to hacking was spent just trying to get a clean OAuth system integrated with novella. However, with the guidance of some friendly FreshBooks mentors, our team was able to overcome the challenge and work towards our envision for novella. It was also a challenge for our front end team to integrate python with HTML. Using flask was a challenge at first, especially since it is non-linear programming, which most of us were use to. However, by working together as frontend and backend programmers, we were able to come together through flask and learning how to use it to create a powerful tool."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"Hackathons are hard! You are surrounded by people who know way more than you and who have been doing this way longer! It can be really intimidating to be surrounded by such accomplished hackers. However, for us, creating novella was a huge learning experience that we enjoyed each moment of. We had been discussing novella for a long time and were excited to finally be able to work on our passion project. The fact that both sides of our team were able to learn about powerful tools that we will use may times in our programming careers is something to be proud of! We worked really hard, learned a lot, had fun, and made connections. We are proud of our hack and we are proud of ourselves!"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"By building novella we learned about great tech skills like user authentication and python integrations. However, we also learned about the importance of planning and coming prepared. If we had not made a plan in advanced, we would not have been able to polish novella as much as we did. We also did a ton of research into what is important to small businesses and entrepreneurs. With a strong foundation and process, and is ready to begin taking bigger and more ambitious steps to grow. We also learned that FreshBooks spent 10 million dollars on updating their website!!! That is so much money! We also had to refresh ourselves on some of our finance classes to prepare for novella. From start to end, novella taught us so much."},{"heading":"What's next for novella","content":"What is next for novella is to clean up some of the code and continue adding features. We are really proud of how novella turned out over the weekend but it is only the start.

Compared to high school classrooms, lecture halls are far larger, creating the first of the problems that we aim to solve: Students who do not want to ask questions simply because it would involve yelling across a large lecture hall, and even if they were able to catch up with the professor after the lecture, the information would not be as useful compared to if it was presented while discussion was still on the topic of the question. The second problem we aim to solve is to encourage students that are too nervous to ask a question simply because they think it is a silly question. By presenting the questions in a semi-anonymous fashion, these students will be able to ask questions while avoiding the shyness that some students feel when asking a question in front of a large class. Real-time answers make learning more efficient and help students succeed without having to worry about how loud they can shout or how silly their question may or may not be."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The main purpose of QueueNA is to forward any questions that students in a lecture think of during the course of the lecture to the professor, where they can answer the questions sooner rather than later. This is done through a system that gives students an input field to ask a question. As soon as a student sends a question, it gets put into a list of questions for the professor to answer. The professors see the student’s questions on an external display with our web app. They then have the choice to answer it on their own timing (in which case, the current focus question will be displayed to everyone) or dismiss it, in order to tell the student to come see the professor later if the question is too complicated."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"QueueNA’s frontend is built using a combination of React and Grommet. For hosting, database and authentication services, we chose to use Firebase because of the simplicity of adding the required functions into our web app with minimal time wasted."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the largest challenges that we faced during our development process was getting React and Firebase to work together. Firebase hosting is generally meant for simpler types of websites, which we learned quite quickly when we had to configure Firebase’s settings to work with a separate build folder instead of a project folder, among many other configuration issues. Another challenge that we faced was designing the UI - Grommet, while it had the potential to make a very good looking UI, was not always consistent between devices - the usage of ‘small, medium and large’ settings instead of size settings that used units such as em or percent meant that some UI elements looked off on other devices."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are very proud of our work here at Hack the North this year. Through well-organized teamwork, we were able to develop an aesthetically pleasing web application in 36 hours while learning much about how to do it along the way. On top of that, for 3 out of the 4 members on our team, this was their first hackathon, making the challenge even more interesting yet fulfilling."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Throughout the course of Hack the North, we gained many new skills. For all of us, this was our first major project using Firebase, so experimenting with how it worked and how to implement it was a big part of our learning here. Some of us also learned the basics of WebSockets and the potential uses for it, namely the ability to update screens in real time from external sources. Finally, for some of us, this was our first time working with a front-end framework such as React, which proved to be an entirely different and yet very interesting way to build a webpage."},{"heading":"What's next for QueueNA","content":"Through brainstorming within our team as well as many conversations with both students and professors to see what our customer base desires, we have come up with several potential future additions to QueueNA. Firstly, a voting system. Without a system like this, the potential for duplicate questions is greatly increased, so by using a system where students can upvote other students questions that they are also wondering about, the professor can see which questions have the most interest. Secondly, we would like to add a classwide polling system to allow professors to poll the entire class to see how well the class understands a concept. Thirdly, the ability to determine whether or not a user is a student or a professor is currently being investigated. The easiest way would be to get a manifest of emails from the institutions that use our system, but we are also considering alternate methods. Finally, support for the LaTeX formatting language is being considered, as while there would be a slight learning curve, it would allow for far easier entry of mathematical expressions that are also easier to read."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"firebase grommet javascript react xe"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"queuena2019.web.app github.com"}]},{"project_title":"TARP - Target.

No one wishes to view advertisements that are not meant for them. Moreover, we spend most of out time walking on streets, driving on roads, roaming around in malls, visiting cafes and restaurants - Digital Boards showcasing advertisements are present almost everywhere. Thus, there is an immense need of intelligent advertising on offline mechanisms."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"It collects demographics of the viewing population via an image sensor, then it uses a matching algorithm to match the advertisements to display boards maximising user targeting and user suitability. The demographics taken into consideration at the moment are - gender, age group and eye moment to ensure long eye contact. The advertisements form a queue infront of each display board and are then displayed on the basis on realtime estimates via geometry and cost minimisation."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"PART - 1 : (Board to Advertisements) Matching and Queuing Technology\n\nCamera on Offline Advertising Spots generates the demographics of the viewing audience using Azure Cognitive Services Face API JSON Data obtained is processed, centroid of viewing population for each billboard is estimated. These Centroids are maintained in Firebase Realtime Database. Advertisements and Billboard Centroids are plotted on 4 Dimensional Graph and each advertisement searches for the nearest billboard and enters its queue.\n\nPART - 2 : Advertisers' Portal\n\nLogin is done via Facebook Login API Advertisers can check the following details : Viewership Display Time of their Advertisements Amount Spent Relevant Viewership Advertisers can make Payments for future display of advertisements via the payment page. Payment Page uses TD Da Vinci API for Transfer of Funds"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The first challenge was to decide the factors that are prevalent for user targeting advertising. The demographic factors had to be streamlined to three for present working. Moreover, these factors were then processed via Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services Face API Handling Realtime databases is a tiring task, but Firebase Realtime Database simplified the process. Payment and User Login are considered to be very time consuming development tasks, usage of Facebook Login API and TD Payment API came to our rescue with these challenges."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud to share that TARP is capable of displaying user targeted advertisements to the most accurate viewing strata of population in realtime. Moreover, it ensures that advertisers pay a fair price as costing is based on display time of advertisements ( of highest priority level), Percentage of Interested Relevant Audience along with multipliers based on average footfall."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learnt how to approach critical problem statements in a structured manner and consider all the edge cases. We solved challenges that may arise in real time scenarios. We worked with the aim to make our solution on offline user-targeted advertising scalable and efficient. We adopted a business model that can bring stability to the dynamic pricing of offline advertising industry."},{"heading":"What's next for TARP - Target. Advertise. Revolutionalise.

I decided to develop a memory game that is suitable for all ages. For kids, it will help them increase concentration and improve memory. For adults, it will help them exercise their minds and reduce the risk of dementia at an older age. Traditionally, match-up games and flashcards are played as separate games. But I wanted to create a new type of game that combines the characteristics of these games in a fun way. The game design of this app is the result of this effort. To make it easy for users to create new cards for the game, Azure Vision and Text Analytics API's are used to analyze the text and images the user drags onto the screen.
