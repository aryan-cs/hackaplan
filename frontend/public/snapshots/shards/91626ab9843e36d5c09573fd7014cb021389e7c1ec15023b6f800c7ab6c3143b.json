Most robotic arms are limited to pre-programmed routines, but we wanted something intelligent, an arm that could understand natural language commands, reason about its environment, and execute complex tasks on demand. Our goal was to combine NLP, computer vision, and real-time robotics control into a single, responsive system. Initially, we thought of using VLAs. However, they are limited in their context and are also an active area of research. Thus, we designed our own pipeline which combines fast inference with reverse-IK and homography to achieve similar results that can scaled much better."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"DUM-E can interpret both spoken and typed commands to manipulate objects with precision. Some of the things it can do include:\n\nSorting parts on a cluttered table. Holding tools while the user works. Executing multi-step tasks based on natural language instructions. Waving, showing sentiment, and other actions.\n\nBy integrating NLP with computer vision, DUM-E doesn’t just react, it understands the scene and decides the best way to interact with objects. Its design is highly generalizable, meaning it can handle new tasks without requiring custom programming."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The arm itself has 3 standard servos and 3 microservos , controlling yaw, three levels of pitch, roll, and the claw. The pipeline works as follows:\n\nObject Detection: A webcam captures the workspace, and OpenCV draws bounding boxes using a segment model onto a birds-eye warped frame through homography. LLM Analysis: Pre-processed images are sent to a multimodal LLM (via Groq) for fast inference. The LLM analyzes object positions and decides which actions the arm should take. It can even access APIs or online data to enhance its reasoning. Command Execution: The LLM sends the instructions to a Flask server on the Raspberry Pi, which communicates with the Arduino Uno. Servo movements are calculated using inverse kinematics to ensure smooth and precise actions. 5DOF IK Arm: The Arm consists of 5 degrees of freedom (1 yaw, 3 pitch, 1 roll + a claw), where we use inverse kinematics to map our arm onto a 3D Cartesian plane for movement. Combining this with homography for accurate 2D Cartesian alignment allows us to open up more potential actions DUM-E can do. NLP stack: The LLama Maverik 109B multimodal was used through Groq so that we can pass in homography and CV detections with cords directly into the model. The Whisper Large V3 was used for speech-to-text capabilities.\n\nThe system uses a feedback loop: real-time arm positions are sent back to the LLM, ensuring consistent and accurate manipulation."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Building DUM-E was far from straightforward. Some of the biggest hurdles included:\n\nTranslating natural language into precise movements across multiple degrees of freedom. Ensuring robust object detection under variable lighting and cluttered environments. Integrating multiple software and hardware layers (LLM, Raspberry Pi, Arduino, CV, voice interface) while keeping latency low. Fine-tuning inverse kinematics to make movements smooth and accurate. Adding conversions and bounds to zero our servos to work with the IK effectively and intuitively. Working with the circuitry as each of the large servos could take up to 2A and small servos 1A, meaning 9A of current running in total. Managing wiring with a 5DOF arm with essentially full rotation capabilities.\n\nEach challenge required iterative testing and creative problem-solving, but overcoming them made the system much stronger."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Successfully combining NLP, computer vision, and robotics hardware into a seamless system. Achieving low-latency, smooth arm movements across multiple degrees of freedom. Creating a generalizable platform capable of executing diverse commands without extra programming. Implementing a feedback-based control loop that improves accuracy and reliability.\n\nIt’s incredibly rewarding to see DUM-E respond in real-time to voice commands and perform tasks with precision."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Through this project, we gained experience bridging advanced NLP with physical robotics. We learned about modular software design, real-time object detection, homography-based localization and vision, and inverse kinematics. Perhaps most importantly, we discovered the value of feedback loops for ensuring consistent and precise execution in multi-layered systems.\n\nWe also learned that the breadboard can surprisingly handle a lot of current relatively well, and that sometimes adding four extra power supplies isn't too bad of an idea!"},{"heading":"What's next for DUM-E","content":"Looking forward, we plan to:\n\nAdd adaptive grasping for irregular and fragile objects. Expand NLP understanding to handle multi-step, context-aware instructions. Implement autonomous task planning for DUM-E to sequence actions independently. Optimize the pipeline for faster inference and lower latency. Explore additional sensors like force or tactile feedback. Develop a portable, standalone version for broader deployment. Use a depth camera for more accurate 3D object processing.\n\nWith these improvements, DUM-E will become an even more intelligent, versatile assistant for any workspace."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino c++ cad groq opencv python raspberry-pi"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"SpeakEasy","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/speakeasy-vdkc9n","tagline":"AI-powered interview practice tool that helps job seekers master behavioral questions through video-based practice.

The gantry runs on two NEMA 17 stepper motors controlled by DRV8825 drivers. The Raspberry Pi 5 serves as the brain: Uses a computer vision (CV) model with a webcam to detect piece movements. Runs a chess engine to reason and decide the next move. Executes a pathfinding algorithm to determine the best way to move pieces without collisions. Instructions are sent to an Arduino, which translates them into motor movements. Chess pieces are magnetized and moved using an electromagnet attached to the gantry. On the software side, the web app integrates AI agents, coaching features."},{"heading":"⚡ Challenges we ran into","content":"The two biggest challenges we can into were building the 2nd axis of the gantry, and the Computer Vision system to detecting chess pieces.

If you visit any art gallery, you'll notice that many of the exhibits are paintings on 2D surfaces. What if you're blind and looking to experience the art as well? What if you could take a picture of a painting and feel the shapes and curves being drawn on your hands?\n\nOur inspiration for this project was based in accessibility, to make the idea of art accessible to the visually impaired by adding the elements of touch, sound, and temperature.\n\nThe inspiration for the name specifically is Bob Ross, who believed that art should be accessible and joyful for everyone, regardless of skill or background."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"ROSS takes in any sort of visual art - paintings, sketches, photography - and transforms it into complete touch and sound experiences without losing its creative information.\n\nThe image is converted into line representations tagged as either warm or cool in color. A two axis robot draws on your outstretched palms using two brushes. One draws with alcohol, the other draws with a heated resistor. These hot and cold brushes convey the color and spacial representations of the art. Narration is then applied for each component drawn, giving detailed descriptions of what is being shown, conveying the semantic information within the art."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"On the hardware side, we utilized 2 Nema Stepper Motors (to move the rails), servo motors (to move the brushes up and down), many 3D printed parts, Arduino to control the different motors, a paint brush dipped in hand sanitizer, and a second paintbrush with a 10 ohm resistor (which we used to generate the heat for the second tip). A web camera was also utilized to provide a way for users to capture the painting image by voice.\n\nTake an input image and feed it into Meta SAM (Segment Anything model) in order to isolate meaningful elements in the painting (e.g. different objects like a tree, person, or building) For each mask, generate a simplified stroke outline. Convert detected strokes into intelligent graph structures that understand how lines connect, where they start and end, and the optimal way to traverse them, similar to how a human artist plans their drawing sequence Transform pixel-based stroke data into smooth, mathematical curves using algorithms like Ramer-Douglas-Peucker simplification. Convert digital coordinates into real-world millimeter measurements with 1mm spacing accuracy, ensuring the robotic reproduction maintains proper proportions and detail resolution on physical canvas. We categorize parts of the painting as warm or cold depending on how similar the colour is to red or blue. Colours closer to red are labeled as red, and colours closer to blue are labeled as blue. Warm colours paint using a warm paint brush warmed by a resistor, and a cold paint brush has hand sanitizer on it. This way one can distinguish between colours. (This is not working completely, so for demo we are using no colours and just one brush) Take all the numerical outputs and feed it to an Arduino which controls the hardware. While painting, we would also play some music which is relevant to the sentiment of the painting, as well as a Bob Ross voiceover (from this fine-tuned HuggingFace model: https://huggingface.co/drewThomasson/Xtts-FineTune-Bob-Ross )"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Many issues with making sure the hardware could move the brushes in the right direction We tried to find many free speech to voice APIs to mimic Bob Ross's voice, but we could not find a super good one."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Built a complete end-to-end system that connects computer vision, stroke optimization, and hardware control into one seamless demo.

We had to manage complex state between the map viewport, the search components, and the data filtering panels, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience in a resizable layout (resizable-layout.tsx)."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Executing Real-World Device Tracking: Our proudest accomplishment is the successful execution of the live tracking phase. We built a system that could actively monitor and record the real-world movements of hundreds of devices simultaneously, generating a unique and powerful dataset for investigation. Creating a True AI Analyst: We successfully integrated a Cohere-powered LLM that goes beyond simple chat. By using Tool Use, our chatbot acts as an intelligent data analyst, allowing non-technical users to perform complex spatio-temporal queries using plain English."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project was a deep dive into the practical challenges of large-scale data engineering. Generating hundreds of thousands of location pings was just the first step; managing, querying, and visualizing that data proved to be a significant undertaking. We learned that with a massive spatio-temporal dataset, naive queries are unacceptably slow, making database performance paramount. This underscored the importance of proper database indexing, specifically with PostGIS's GIST indexes, and writing efficient SQL to query by both location and time simultaneously. We also encountered significant bottlenecks in transferring and rendering the data on the frontend. Sending hundreds of thousands of points to a web browser is not feasible, which taught us to design our backend API to be intelligent, performing the heavy lifting of filtering and aggregation on the server side. This ensures that the frontend only has to render data relevant to the user's view, preventing the map from freezing. Finally, we learned about the complexity of maintaining data integrity at scale. Ingesting data at high frequency requires atomic database transactions to prevent partial writes and robust error handling to deal with API failures without corrupting the dataset. Managing this volume of data taught us to think defensively about every step of the data pipeline."},{"heading":"What's next for Sauron","content":"Moving forward, our primary focus is on enhancing the platform's accuracy and reliability. To increase the richness of our data, our next step is to integrate additional data sources, exploring implementations similar to Geospy to fuse location data from multiple providers and create a more comprehensive picture of device movements. We also plan to engage directly with potential customers in law enforcement and private investigative sectors to ensure our development aligns with their real-world needs and workflows. To make the platform more bulletproof against future changes to the undocumented APIs we rely on, we will build a dedicated iOS emulator. This controlled environment will allow us to safely analyze the API's behavior in-depth, ensuring our data ingestion process remains stable and reliable for the long term."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"apis cohere flask geocode gps nextjs react reverse-engineering supabase wps"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Tango","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/tango-q37d4z","tagline":"Siri if it actually worked on your Mac.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/738/975/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2025: Finalists"},{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Graphite: Engineering Dream Team"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"agent","url":null},{"name":"ai","url":null},{"name":"gemini","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gemini"},{"name":"groq","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/groq"},{"name":"openai","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"voice","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/demanr/tango"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"How many times have you copy pasted something just to put it through an LLM and regurgitate it's answer back where you were?

Sensor interference: The Kinects use LiDAR for distance sensing, and if positioned weirdly, th elasers can interfere with each other, making the detection inaccurate Discontinuation of the Hololens made it hard to find good documentation for using it. It's also incompatible with most new technology since.

The whole stack is heavily optimized for performance in order to create a seamless user experience."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We interface with Git using python's subprocess module. We use FastAPI to serve our backend and our frontend is a simple react/nextJS layer. For our AI agent, we use openai-agent with models powered by Cerebras for blazing-fast performance. Cerebras was especially important; it was significantly faster than every other model, which let us provide a seamless timeline streaming interface. To provide a comprehensive full-project summary, we used Cohere.\n\nIn our gallery, you can see RepoStory telling you exactly how we built it!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The project can be thought of as having 4 main steps:\n\nFetching: this is where Github objects are programmatically queried and loaded in memory/storage. Milestone detection: this is a challenging tasks that asks us what the best way to define a \"Milestone\" is; Milestones are defined by start and end commits, and have to encode data that will allow an AI agent to process the milestone, creating a key data availability problem. Processing: in this step, we take raw milestones and use the power of NLP and AI agents to create data for our front facing application. The AI agent is trained to lazily collect data about the commits in the milestone in steps of increasing complexity, then finally use that data to choose files to examine (e.g. it's more likely to query the diff for mymodule.py, than node_modules, for example). Frontend: Create a smooth UX for the user of the application. Super simple: just paste in a project, and watch the timeline as it smoothly generates. Required streaming data about the agent's tool uses to keep the user in the loop.\n\nLet's talk about the main problems:\n\nPerformance\n\nPerformance is our #1 priority, from the top to bottom of our entire stack. When we initialize a git repository, we don't fetch any blobs; we only fetch git tree objects. Many git operations rely on finding diffs between blobs; when we do these, we have to make sure those operations are executed as little as possible.\n\nHere's one large architecture problem that we're really proud of: For our system, we want to select commit hashes that represent the edges of \"milestones\". The naive strategy is to select based on groups of N commits. However, this is not a good idea as the contents of commits are very varied and there are other factors such as merge commits. People also tend to commit at different frequencies.\n\nFor our initial naive approach, we simply selected every single merge commit, as these merges indicate the end of some unit of work done. However, this is also very inconsistent; people who use a rebase strategy do not produce merge commits, and this would simply not work at all on completely linear histories.\n\nFor our final approach, we devised a super cool solution. We created heuristics that could roughly measure \"work done\" between two commits, and output it as a scalar; then starting from the first commit, we want to find the next commit that exceeds the threshold value. Assuming that our measurement of \"work done\" is increasing, we can binary search for this commit!\n\nGit provides a \"bisect\" utility that is usually used for finding the last \"good\" commit before some bug was introduced. You mark a bad commit and a good commit, and the bisect tool will iterate through some commits, asking you to mark them as bad/good, effectively binary searching for the last bad commit. You can provide this tool with a script that can check whether the commit is bad or good automatically. Thus, we can use this to perform our procedure.\n\nGit bisect docs\n\nWhen starting from commit A, we can mark A as a \"bad\" commit, and the latest commit as a \"good\" commit. We also have this script:\n\n../../scoregen.py <ref1> <ref2> --limit <float>\n\nscoregen.py will exit with code 1 if the \"work\" between the two references is greater than the limit. Thus, we can pass it in to git bisect, and it will eventually land on our desired commit!\n\nOur project was full of super interesting problems with really interesting solutions."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Working git subprocess interface; the amount of work we put into ensuring we had a nice, modular git interaction system, as well as hyper-optimizing the performance Working agentic AI subsystem able to dynamically load file diffs to acquire its own context Working milestone selection framework and strategy ## What we learned Git internals!

The goal is to build a dashboard experience that, upon user login, intelligently surfaces a curated set of submissions that are most aligned with the carrier's appetite; enabling faster and more effective underwriting decisions.”\n\nThis sparked the idea for Optimate , our AI-powered underwriting dashboard. Underwriters often face the challenge of sifting through massive amounts of policy data to make high-stakes decisions under pressure. We wanted to reimagine this workflow by combining:\n\nAI and reinforcement learning to prioritize in-appetite submissions. Interactive dashboards for clarity and transparency. Data-driven insights grounded in underwriting guidelines and risk metrics. Live tracking and plots to monitor portfolio performance in real time. Heatmap visualizations to instantly show policies across states, colored by appetite and risk scores.\n\nOur inspiration came from observing how underwriters juggle complex, and sometimes conflicting, factors; such as Total Insured Value (TIV), loss ratios, building age, and state regulations. By building Optimate, we aimed to show how modern AI and intuitive visual design can turn this complexity into actionable intelligence, enabling smarter, faster, and more confident decisions."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Optimate is an AI-powered underwriting dashboard designed to make risk assessment smarter, faster, and more transparent.

Understand the “why” : Access a detailed breakdown of AI-driven justifications and rules that explain why each submission was prioritized. Take action with confidence : Approve or decline submissions directly from the dashboard, supported by clear reasoning and data. Train the AI : Provide feedback and satisfaction scores that feed into reinforcement learning, making the system smarter over time. Visualize risks : Explore an interactive heatmap of U.S. states showing areas of high and low risk appetite, alongside dynamic plots and live tracking of portfolio performance. Chat with AI : Engage in two-way conversations with the AI at the individual policy level, enabling underwriters to ask questions, receive clarifications, and co-decide on risk assessment with contextual awareness.\n\nTogether, these features make Optimate a one-stop platform for turning underwriting complexity into clarity."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built Optimate as a full-stack application combining a modern web framework, AI services, and scalable cloud infrastructure to deliver real-time insights to underwriters.\n\nFrontend & Deployment Built using Next.js (App Router) and deployed on Vercel for fast, serverless performance and seamless CI/CD. Used TailwindCSS and shadcn/ui to design a clean, consistent, and responsive interface with minimal overhead, enabling rapid iteration of charts, heatmaps, and dashboards. Integrated Auth0 for secure authentication and role-based login, ensuring underwriters have personalized access to their own submissions and preferences. Data Layer & Processing Pulled the Federato API dataset (policies, premiums, TIV, loss ratios, etc.) and ingested it through a Python pipeline , where we enriched the raw data with: Risk scores and appetite scores based on underwriting guidelines. Live tracking metrics for policies over time. Aggregated account-level analytics weighted by premium and loss ratio. Stored enriched data in a format optimized for visualization and AI query workloads. AI & Insights Engine Used Cohere’s LLMs with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline: Broke policy data and underwriting guidelines into embeddings and indexed them. Enabled the AI to justify its decisions (“why this policy is in-appetite”) by pulling grounded references from guidelines and historical data. Implemented reinforcement learning from underwriter feedback , where every approve/decline and satisfaction score helps refine appetite scoring logic over time. Added a context-aware AI chatbot that works at the individual policy level , enabling underwriters to have two-way conversations with the AI about specific submissions. Storage & State Management All application state, including user preferences, saved searches, favorite policies, chat history, and cached embeddings metadata , is persisted in DynamoDB , giving us low-latency reads and writes at scale. This persistence enables underwriters to pick up where they left off, track past decisions, and build a living history of their interactions with the AI. Visualizations & Analytics Leveraged Recharts and custom D3 visualizations to build: Interactive plots of policy performance metrics. Heatmaps of U.S. states colored by appetite/risk scores. Dynamic leaderboards of top in-appetite policies. Designed the dashboard to surface both macro insights (portfolio-level risk distribution) and micro insights (policy-by-policy explanations).\n\nIn short, Optimate integrates a modern web stack with AI-driven insights, reinforcement learning, and powerful visualizations; all aimed at making underwriting decisions smarter and more transparent."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Domain Understanding Insurance and underwriting were completely new domains for our team. At first, we struggled to understand concepts like Total Insurable Value (TIV) , loss ratios , and appetite guidelines . It took deliberate effort to translate Federato’s problem statement and sample guidelines into clear, actionable rules for our AI model and dashboard. Once we built that context, we could design features that truly aligned with underwriters’ workflows.\n\nCollaboration & Version Control Working as a team of four developers in a time-boxed hackathon meant rapid iteration and frequent code merges. Naturally, merge conflicts cropped up in our GitHub repo. We learned to coordinate by:\n\nEstablishing a practice of announcing merges into main , Pulling changes immediately after merges, and Splitting work into smaller, well-scoped branches to reduce overlap. This improved our velocity and reduced lost time on conflicts.\n\nAI Model Development We wanted our AI to do more than simple filtering. Designing the reinforcement learning loop was challenging, especially under hackathon constraints. We had to:\n\nDefine reward functions based on underwriter satisfaction feedback, Balance rule-based scoring (from appetite guidelines) with LLM-powered reasoning , and Build a lightweight but extendable training loop that could adapt over time. This gave us a crash course in connecting theory (RL foundations) with real-world application .\n\nCloud Infrastructure We chose AWS DynamoDB for storing user data, embeddings, and chat histories because of its scalability and low latency. But setting it up securely was non-trivial. Challenges included:\n\nConfiguring IAM roles and policies to avoid over-permissive access, Ensuring smooth integration with our Next.js app, and Handling rate limits and schema design under the pressure of real-time queries.\n\nVisualization & Real-Time Data Designing meaningful heatmaps, plots, and live tracking views presented both technical and design hurdles. We had to map appetite scores and risk metrics into visuals that underwriters could understand at a glance. Optimizing rendering performance for large datasets while keeping the UI responsive was a balancing act.\n\nDespite these hurdles, each challenge became an opportunity: we learned new domains, tightened our team workflow, pushed our AI design skills, and deployed a secure, scalable cloud app; all within the hackathon timeframe."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Timely Delivery We successfully built and delivered a working product within the hackathon timeframe, ensuring it stayed aligned with Federato’s problem statement while going beyond the basics with live tracking, heatmaps, and an AI chatbot.\n\nAdopting New Technologies Our team dove into new tools and frameworks; CohereAI, Auth0, AWS DynamoDB, Next.js (App Router), and shadcn/ui ; and integrated them into a production-ready application in just a few days. This rapid learning curve not only expanded our technical toolkit but also boosted our confidence in quickly mastering unfamiliar technologies.\n\nAI Model Exploration We researched and implemented the fundamentals of reinforcement learning , applying it to real-world underwriting data. While lightweight, our model demonstrated how underwriter feedback (approve/decline, satisfaction scores) could guide iterative improvement of appetite scoring.\n\nVisual Storytelling We built intuitive plots, live tracking views, and heatmaps that made abstract metrics like risk score and appetite score immediately understandable. Seeing complex insurance data come alive visually was one of our proudest achievements."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Improved Team Communication Working under time pressure taught us the importance of concise, transparent communication.

By working with appetite guidelines, TIV, loss ratios, and premiums, we developed a clearer picture of how underwriters balance competing factors and why decision-support tools like Optimate can make a real impact.\n\nHackathon Mindset Perhaps most importantly, we learned how to take a vague, high-level challenge and turn it into a polished, end-to-end solution that blends AI, cloud, and UX in a way that solves real-world problems."},{"heading":"What's next for Optimate","content":"We see Optimate not just as a hackathon project, but as the foundation of a scalable underwriting intelligence platform. Our next steps include:\n\nDeeper AI Integration : Expand beyond RAG and reinforcement learning by exploring fine-tuned LLMs that can model more nuanced underwriting strategies and simulate “what-if” scenarios for submissions. Real-Time Data Feeds : Integrate external data sources such as weather risks, property valuation APIs, or catastrophe modeling to make appetite scores more dynamic and responsive to changing conditions. Explainability at Scale : Enhance the AI explanations with richer visual cues (confidence intervals, score breakdowns, and sensitivity analysis) so underwriters can trust not just the results, but the reasoning. Collaborative Workflows : Add features for teams of underwriters; such as shared views, comments, and case histories; to bring transparency and accountability to group decisions. Mobile & Cross-Platform Support : Extend Optimate to mobile and tablet experiences so underwriters can access dashboards and chat with the AI on the go. Production-Grade Infrastructure : Move from DynamoDB prototypes to a more robust multi-region cloud setup with monitoring, audit trails, and enterprise-grade security, making it deployable in real-world underwriting teams.\n\nBy continuing to evolve Optimate, we aim to transform it into a trusted partner for underwriters; combining the precision of AI, the clarity of visualization, and the adaptability of human feedback."},{"heading":"Conclusion","content":"With Optimate , we set out to reimagine underwriting by blending AI, data visualization, and human feedback into one seamless platform.

This approach not only solved our immediate integration challenges but also made our system more maintainable and scalable for future development."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're incredibly proud of developing a polished product that leverages agentic AI to intelligently analyze web pages and automatically generate comprehensive storyboards. Our system goes beyond simple screen capture - it understands the purpose and flow of web interfaces, creating structured narratives that guide users through meaningful product demonstrations. We are also proud of our seamless incorporation of Groq Cloud's text-to-speech AI voice agent to create dynamic, contextual voiceovers. Rather than using generic text-to-speech, our system intelligently interprets the JSON storyboard data to generate natural, engaging narration that adapts to each demo's specific content . The voice agent understands the context of each scene, creating smooth transitions and explanatory commentary that feels genuinely helpful rather than robotic. What makes us most proud is how these components work together to create an autonomous demo generation pipeline, from webpage analysis to final voiced video, maintaining professional quality throughout."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project provided invaluable insights across multiple domains:\n\nTechnical Skills: We deepened our expertise in advanced web automation techniques, mastered large-scale video processing workflows, and gained hands-on experience integrating multiple AI models into a cohesive system. The complexity of orchestrating browser automation, video rendering, and AI processing taught us valuable lessons about system architecture and performance optimization.\n\nProduct Development: We discovered just how critical high-quality demos are for product adoption - and more importantly, how much time development teams actually invest in creating compelling video content. This reinforced our belief that automating this process addresses a real pain point that many teams face but rarely discuss openly.\n\nAI/ML Applications: Working with agentic AI models revealed the practical challenges of prompt engineering, response consistency, and managing AI unpredictability in production environments. Implementing Groq's Voice AI agent API taught us about balancing API costs, latency considerations, and the nuances of creating natural-sounding, contextually aware voice synthesis that enhances the user experience."},{"heading":"What's next for One Take","content":"Our next major focus is expanding beyond simple product demos to tackle complex, multi-step workflows. We envision One Take automatically understanding and demonstrating intricate processes like onboarding sequences, checkout flows, admin dashboards, and cross-platform integrations. This means developing more sophisticated AI that can recognize workflow patterns and user journeys without explicit guidance.\n\nCurrently, users need to specify what type of demo they want - but we're working toward complete autonomy. Imagine simply providing a URL and having One Take intelligently analyze the webpage, identify the most valuable user flows, determine the target audience, and automatically generate multiple demo variations. The system would understand context clues like page structure, user interface patterns, and business objectives to create relevant demonstrations without any human prompting.\n\nWe're exploring AI that can automatically customize demos for different audiences - generating technical deep-dives for developers, high-level overviews for executives, and user-focused walkthroughs for end customers, all from the same source material.\n\nThe ultimate vision is a system that proactively generates updated demos whenever it detects changes to a website, ensuring marketing and sales teams always have current, professional video content without lifting a finger."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"chromium cohere ffmpeg groq javascript json python react typescript windsurf"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"CourseIntelligence","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/courseinteligence","tagline":"Making academic and professional lives easier for students around the world!

Old friends reconnected 🤝, and through Raed we met Allen, who quickly became part of the group. By the end of the weekend, we were no longer just teammates; we were friends building something meaningful together.\n\nAs we caught up, we realized how much of our friendship had always been built around storytelling 📖: sharing memories, retelling old moments, and imagining new ones. Stories are more than just words; they are how we reconnect, how we preserve identity, and how we relive what matters most.\n\nThat realization sparked SpectraSphere ✨. We wanted to make stories something you can not only tell but actually step inside. With Snapchat Spectacles 👓, we set out to reimagine how people experience their own memories, ideas, and imagination. Instead of scrolling through flat images, why not live inside them?"},{"heading":"🛠️ What it does","content":"SpectraSphere turns your prompts and images into immersive AR stories 🌌 that you can step inside using Snapchat Spectacles.\n\nFrom the user’s perspective, it feels simple and magical:\n\nOn our TypeScript web app 💻, you start by writing a story prompt or narrating one with your voice 🎙️. You then upload four images 📷 that capture the essence of your story. With a single click, those inputs are sent directly to your Spectacles 📡. Inside Spectacles, your photos appear around you in a rotatable 3D environment 🔄. You can instantly switch between creative animation styles 🎨 such as Ghibli , cyberpunk , comic , and more each reframing your story through a different “spectra.”\n\nBehind the scenes, SpectraSphere works by combining multiple technologies:\n\nCohere API 🧠 expands and contextualizes the story prompt so the AR experience feels richer than raw text. Gemini API 🌐 manages image generation and styling to adapt uploaded photos to different artistic modes. Lens Studio SDK 🕶️ and Spectacles API bring the story into AR, rendering the 3D environment and enabling smooth style transitions.\n\nThe result is a pipeline that moves seamlessly from prompt to photos to immersive AR storytelling .\n\nRight now, SpectraSphere is designed for photos. Looking ahead, we envision extending this to generational video, evolving narratives, and interactive branching stories where memories come alive as moving, dynamic experiences."},{"heading":"⚙️ How we built it","content":"We approached SpectraSphere as a full pipeline, from frontend interaction to AR rendering, with careful attention to performance on Snap Spectacles.\n\nFrontend and Backend + APIs\n\nWe built a TypeScript web app 💻 as the entry point for storytelling. It handles both text and voice input, manages image uploads, and packages everything into a structured JSON format. The frontend connects directly to Cohere and Gemini through API calls, and performs validation before sending data downstream. We also designed a lightweight Node.js backend 🔗 to coordinate between APIs and our AR pipeline:\n\nCohere is called first to enrich prompts, producing narrative-friendly text. Gemini is then used for media handling, applying transformations and style presets to the uploaded images. The backend includes custom error handling, request batching, and asset optimization to keep responses fast enough for real-time use inside Spectacles.\n\nAR environment\n\nInside Lens Studio 🎭, we built a system for displaying static assets as immersive 3D environments. This includes:\n\nA panel management system that positions and rotates user images in space. A style-switching module that applies multiple artistic filters on demand.\n\nWe tuned these features for stable performance on Spectacles hardware, with optimizations like power-of-two texture scaling and lightweight shader effects.\n\nTesting and validation\n\nBecause hardware time was limited ⏱️, we built a local Node.js testing suite 🧪 to simulate the pipeline. This allowed us to:\n\nValidate API integration with real Cohere and Gemini calls. Benchmark asset loading, memory use, and frame rate. Confirm Lens Studio compatibility before deployment."},{"heading":"🚧 Challenges we ran into","content":"Stepping into AR for the first time 🕶️\n\nNone of us had built for AR or VR before Hack the North. Only Allen had prior Unity experience, and that became our bridge into Lens Studio. The rest of us had to pick things up from scratch: how components work, the strict inheritance rules in TypeScript files, and how Lens Studio expects scripts to interact with 3D objects. The first hours were frustrating, filled with broken builds and cryptic errors, but gradually we adapted and started thinking in terms of AR instead of web.\n\nGemini integration 🔑\n\nMaking the Gemini API key compatible with Snap Spectacles was another major hurdle. Unlike a standard web app, Spectacles access APIs through the Remote Service Gateway, which has strict rules about authentication and security. What should have been “one line of code” turned into an entire debugging session across both the Spectacles environment.\n\nLimited hardware access ⏳\n\nOur time with physical Spectacles was limited, which meant most of development happened blind. To work around this, we built a local testing setup that mimicked the pipeline as closely as possible, complete with mocked API responses and asset loading checks. While this kept progress moving, it also forced us to make educated guesses about real-world performance until late in the build.\n\nHackathon constraints ⏰\n\nWe also hit the universal hackathon hurdles: sleep-deprived coding sessions, APIs that did not always behave as expected, and tough tradeoffs. For example, we wanted to experiment more deeply with generative video, but Gemini’s rate limits and our time window meant focusing on photo panels and text to speech instead of video generation."},{"heading":"🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Bridging web and AR environments 🌉\n\nOne of our proudest achievements was successfully connecting a modern web stack with Snap Spectacles. Moving data from a TypeScript application into Lens Studio required us to reconcile two very different development paradigms. We built a consistent pipeline that packages user prompts and images in a format Spectacles could reliably interpret. This integration made it possible for Spectrasphere to feel seamless to the user, despite the complexity happening under the hood.\n\nOvercoming Gemini integration barriers 🔒\n\nGetting Gemini to work within the constraints of the Spectacles environment was another milestone. Through the Remote Service Gateway, we had to solve authentication issues, handle asynchronous responses, and adapt outputs for rendering in Lens Studio. By the end of the hackathon, we had a functioning system where Gemini-generated content flowed directly into AR, a result that required both persistence and careful engineering.\n\nRapid mastery of Lens Studio ⚡\n\nMost of the team had never touched AR before, yet in under two days we went from confusion to competence with Lens Studio. We learned how components, inheritance rules, and TypeScript scripts fit together in a 3D space. By the final demo, we had a working AR environment that positioned panels correctly and allowed creative style switching. The speed at which we adapted to these tools is something we take pride in."},{"heading":"📚 What we learned","content":"Planning before executing 📝\n\nWe discovered quickly that jumping straight into development without mapping out the user flow created unnecessary setbacks. Early attempts to link the frontend, APIs, and Lens Studio led to broken states and confusing errors. Taking a step back to plan the pipeline, from prompt to images to AR rendering, proved essential. This reinforced how important architecture and data flow design are, even under hackathon pressure.\n\nSimplifying the stack 🧩\n\nIt was tempting to keep adding new technologies to cover gaps, but we learned that simplicity is often more powerful. Instead of experimenting with extra services, we focused on making Cohere, Gemini, and Lens Studio work reliably together. Keeping the stack lean allowed us to spend more time polishing the experience and less time wrestling with unnecessary complexity.\n\nRapidly learning new tools 🚀\n\nFor most of the team, Lens Studio was completely unfamiliar. We had to quickly adapt to its component system, TypeScript scripting rules, and the way it handles 3D environments. This showed us that even without prior AR experience, strong programming fundamentals and a willingness to learn can get you from zero to a working demo in a short time."},{"heading":"🔮 What's next for HTN","content":"Seamless integration with Snapchat Memories 📲\n\nOne of our first priorities is to connect SpectraSphere directly to Snapchat Memories. Instead of manually uploading images, users could select past experiences already saved in their accounts, and instantly relive them in AR. This would allow stories to be created and experienced with minimal friction, making SpectraSphere feel like a natural extension of everyday life.\n\nExpanded creative toolset 🎨\n\nWe plan to broaden the style library far beyond the initial Ghibli, cyberpunk, and comic filters. Future iterations will allow users to layer effects, mix artistic aesthetics, and even train personal styles unique to their own memories. By giving users more control over how their stories look and feel, SpectraSphere becomes not only a storytelling platform but also a creative studio.\n\nInteractive and collaborative narratives 🤝\n\nStorytelling becomes even more powerful when it is shared. We envision interactive narratives where users can make choices that branch the story in real time, or invite friends to co-create an experience together. Imagine building a collective trip diary, where each person’s photos and memories merge into a single immersive AR environment.\n\nApplications beyond personal storytelling 🌍\n\nWhile SpectraSphere began with memories, the same platform can support education, travel, and entertainment. Teachers could create explorable history lessons, travellers could share experiences as immersive journals, and artists could experiment with interactive AR exhibitions. By positioning SpectraSphere as a flexible framework, we open possibilities across many domains."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cohere gemini google-cloud json lens-studio-sdk postman remote-service-gateway snap-spectacles snapchat typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"CRASH OUT!","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/crash-out-bte6q0","tagline":"lets you crash out, whenever, wherever, whatever (on the drums).","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/741/227/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Snap: Spectacles AR Hackathon: Game On!"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"adc","url":null},{"name":"ar","url":null},{"name":"audacity","url":null},{"name":"blender","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender"},{"name":"chatgpt","url":null},{"name":"circuits","url":null},{"name":"embedded","url":null},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"lego","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"qnx","url":null},{"name":"raspberry","url":null},{"name":"redbull","url":null},{"name":"rtos","url":null},{"name":"spectacle","url":null},{"name":"sugar","url":null},{"name":"ts","url":null},{"name":"websockets","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/dagsion/HTN25_Instrument"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Coming into Hack The North, all four of us were hyped to do a hardware-based project.

Semantic Understanding & Reranking We use Cohere's embeddings and reranking API to understand the semantic meaning behind user ideas. When someone enters \"AI tool for lost cars\", our system doesn't just match keywords - it understands this relates to automotive technology, IoT, and safety. The reranking API then scores all 200+ personas by relevance, ensuring we select the perfect focus group of 5 personas who would genuinely care about this product.\n\n2. Multi-Stage Text Generation Each persona's reaction is generated through a sophisticated Cohere-powered pipeline:\n\nContext Analysis : Understanding the product idea's nuances Persona Modeling : Generating responses that align with each persona's unique characteristics Sentiment Extraction : Structured analysis of positive/negative signals Insight Synthesis : Aggregating patterns across all reactions\n\n3. Intelligent Refinement When users collect feedback and hit \"Refine\", Cohere analyzes all negative feedback, identifies common themes, and generates an improved product pitch that addresses the concerns - all while maintaining the original vision.\n\nVapi - Bringing Personas to Life Through Voice\n\nVapi transforms our AI personas from data points into conversational partners:\n\n1. Dynamic Voice Selection Each persona gets a voice that matches their profile - we programmatically select from PlayHT's voice library based on gender, age, and personality traits. A Gen Z female developer sounds different from a Baby Boomer male CFO.\n\n2. Contextual Conversations When users click \"Call\" on a persona, Vapi receives:\n\nThe complete persona profile (demographics, psychographics, interests) The original product idea The persona's specific reaction and reasoning Historical context from the simulation\n\nThis creates incredibly realistic conversations where personas defend their positions, explain their concerns, and even suggest alternatives.\n\n3. Real-Time WebRTC Streaming Voice conversations happen with <100ms latency, making interactions feel natural. Users can interrupt, ask follow-ups, and have genuine back-and-forth discussions about their product ideas.\n\nMongoDB Atlas - Scalable Data Architecture\n\nMongoDB Atlas serves as our flexible, scalable backbone for complex data relationships:\n\n1. Document-Based Persona Storage Each persona is stored as a rich document with nested attributes - demographics, psychographics, personality scores, and interaction history. MongoDB's flexible schema lets us evolve persona structures without migrations.\n\n2. Session State Management Complete simulation states are stored as documents, including:\n\nAll persona reactions Globe visualization states Refinement history Voice conversation transcripts\n\nThis enables our powerful session restoration - users can share a URL and recipients see the exact same analysis state.\n\n3. Geospatial Queries We leverage MongoDB's geospatial indexing for the 3D globe - efficiently querying personas by geographic region and calculating geographic market penetration patterns.\n\nAuth0 - Revolutionary Agent Management\n\nThe most innovative aspect of Tunnel is how we use Auth0's Management API to create living, breathing digital personas:\n\n1. Dynamic Agent Creation We leverage Auth0's Management API to dynamically create an account for every single agent that grows and evolves over time. After submitting a prompt, we generate Auth0 accounts with rich metadata attributes:\n\nDemographics (age, location, industry) Psychographics (risk tolerance, tech adoption) Personality scores (openness, conscientiousness) Behavioral patterns that evolve based on interactions\n\n2. Multi-Tenant Isolation Each user's workspace is completely isolated using Auth0's tenant features. Your competitors can't see your simulations, and enterprise clients get dedicated environments.\n\n3. Persona Evolution As users interact with personas through voice calls or multiple simulations, we update the Auth0 user profiles. Personas remember past interactions, creating a more realistic simulation over time - they might reference previous products they've evaluated or show fatigue for similar ideas.\n\nTunnel - Because your next billion-dollar idea deserves more than a guess."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"auth0 cloudflare cohere dagre javascript mongodb next.js radix react three.js typescript vapi vercel"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Vraille","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/vraille","tagline":"Redefining Accessibility: Real-Time Awareness for the Visually Impaired With Gemini-Powered Glasses & Dynamic Braille","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/740/643/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"VAPI: Best Voice AI Application"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"c++","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3"},{"name":"cohere","url":null},{"name":"facedetection","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/facedetection"},{"name":"gemini","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gemini"},{"name":"meta","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/meta"},{"name":"multimodal","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"solidworks","url":null},{"name":"supabase","url":null},{"name":"vapi","url":null},{"name":"websockets","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets"},{"name":"windsurf","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/KaivalSShah/vraille-htn2025"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Approximately 2.2 billion people worldwide suffer from mild to severe vision impairment, negatively impacting their physical and digital interactions. To that end, the latest advancements in smart glasses and vision technology prioritize convenience features and narrowly defined use cases over comprehensive systems purposefully designed for the visually impaired. As a result, those with visual impairments are unable to tap into the ways technology can change their lives.\n\nThink memory recall systems for those who are forced to match faint voices to their dearest loved ones, or navigation tools that provide real-time spatial awareness in complex, unfamiliar environments.\n\nThe lack of sufficient technological progress in these directions leaves the visually impaired with no choice but to resort to archaic solutions such as guide dogs and canes—tools that, while reliable, fundamentally fail to harness the potential of modern computing.\n\nBut, what if we could hack the previously antiquated physical and digital systems to bring novelty and the latest advancements to the lives of billions of visually impaired folks around the world?\n\nIntroducing Vraille (Vision + Braille) — the AI glasses layer built for the visually impaired using Gemini-orchestrated voice automation and a dynamic braille interface."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Vraille transforms the way visually impaired individuals interact with their surroundings by combining three core innovations:\n\nReal-time environmental understanding: using Meta glasses with live video and audio feeds, Vraille interprets the user’s environment and delivers contextual awareness powered by Gemini’s multimodal AI. Conversational interaction through Gemini tool calling: through Gemini-orchestrated voice automation, users can naturally ask questions and receive immediate, meaningful responses about their environment — from identifying objects to recalling contextual details. Dynamic braille interface: a tactile, adaptive braille pad translates digital and environmental information into touch in real time, offering a discreet alternative to audio cues. This ensures users can navigate and learn without causing disruption in quiet or shared spaces.\n\nTogether, these features give visually impaired users an intuitive and empowering interface to both their physical and digital worlds. Vraille addresses the long-standing stagnation in accessibility tech by rethinking and adapting the latest advancements (e.g. Multimodal AI, voice agents, tool calling, among other technologies) to create solutions that truly make a lasting difference."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We developed the software and hardware components of Vraille by integrating several cutting-edge technologies and collaborating effectively to make it happen! The notable technologies we adopted to create Vraille include:\n\n• Gemini tool calling for real-time multimodal reasoning and environment understanding. • Vapi voice agents to enable seamless, natural conversation between the user and the system. • Cohere embeddings and models to handle contextual memory recall and natural language understanding. • A custom-built dynamic braille pad powered by microcontrollers and actuators, designed to adapt text and environmental information into tactile feedback in real time. • Real-time face detection using the Face++ API\n\nSpecifically on the hardware side of the project, we designed a custom motorized piston graille pattern to dynamically change the graille text being displayed. This was an ambitious but was achieved due to the amazing resources provided throughout the hackathon."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"On the technical side, applying relatively new technologies like Meta Rayban smart glasses, Vapi voice-control agents, and Gemini Tool calling were the biggest challenges we ran into. Not only did we have to consult company professionals during the event to tackle unprecedented issues, but also did we used multiple layers of processing in order to unleashed the full potential of an existing commercial product. For example, our biggest challenge was to jailbreak the Meta Rayban glasses to use the vision system in our own way by video calling on WhatsApp call, redirecting audio output into the AI Voice Agent in Python, and capturing video feed from the camera on the glasses. The whole process requires a total of 4 additional virtual audio I/O devices. We were constantly working with technologies in ways that not many had done before.\n\nLogistically, we faced a teaming crisis where our team of 4 was coming and leaving. Started with the idea of building something with a combination of hardware and software, we purposefully recruited more mechanically focused role. However, the original two people we reached out too left the team before the competition started. One of the other members later decided to quit because of the misalignment of goals and ideas for this project. With the lack of time and mentors in the hardware area, our progress on the hardware component was severely behind when there was almost no 3D printers available towards the end. Therefore, we built everything without 3d printer and it is completely hand-crafted."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Hacked for 30+ hours, turning what started out as an idea into something that could be so much more! Worked around challenges involving Vapi package dependency incompatibility and gemini tool calling, eventually turning Vraille as a truly intelligent voice-powered agent that could perform (via tool call) various actions for the user. Last but not least, we were able to integrate our unique strengths to build a hardware and software project that has the potential to leave great impact amongst the visually impaired community, which brings us great personal satisfaction."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"• Discuss goals and alignments of ideas ahead of time in the teaming experience • Don't spend too much time on ideas; ideas don’t come fully formed. Start right away and gain some insights along the way, and you might get more sparks! • The hardware component of a project can be the limiting factor for the completion of a project, especially when the team lacks expertise in this area. • Do not rely on materials, resources, and opportunities provided to you. There is no guarantee for what one can get. • Have a structured plan and firm timeline to help the team execute on an idea more efficiently."},{"heading":"What's next for Vraille","content":"• Refining the dynamic braille interface to improve responsiveness and making it more seamless to use in one’s everyday life • Enhancing context given to the LLM responsible for orchestrating the multimodal tool calling workflows. • Improve video and audio quality output from the Meta Rayban glasses, find alternatives, or build our own market."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino c++ cohere facedetection gemini meta multimodal python solidworks supabase vapi websockets windsurf"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Stacy","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/stacy-g7zptj","tagline":"Stacy is a voice safety companion.

Traditional 3D modeling software, while powerful, often has a steep learning curve and relies on clunky keyboard shortcuts and mouse clicks. We asked ourselves: what if we could sculpt 3D objects as naturally as if we were molding clay with our own hands? Our inspiration was to bridge the gap between human intuition and digital creation , building an accessible, immersive, and magical 3D modeling experience right in the browser. We wanted to create a tool that feels less like operating a machine and more like an extension of our own creativity."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"ShapeShift is an innovative, browser-based 3D modeling platform that transforms your webcam into a powerful creation tool. It allows users to interact with a 3D environment in two revolutionary ways:\n\n👋 Real-Time Gesture Control: Using your hands, you can directly manipulate objects in the 3D scene. ShapeShift tracks your hand movements in real-time, allowing you to grab, move, rotate, and scale objects with intuitive gestures, eliminating the need for a mouse and keyboard. 🤖 AI Agent Assistant: ShapeShift features an intelligent AI assistant that understands natural language. You can simply tell the AI what you want to create or modify. For example, you can say, \"Create a red sphere and a blue cube, then place the sphere on top of the cube,\" and the AI will execute the commands. ✨ AI-Powered 3D Model Generation: Stuck for ideas? You can describe a concept like \"a futuristic spaceship\" or \"a stylized tree,\" and our integrated generative AI will create a detailed 3D model for you on the fly, ready to be imported and manipulated in your scene."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"ShapeShift is built on a modern, multi-faceted tech stack designed for real-time performance and intelligence.\n\nFrontend: The entire user interface is a dynamic web application built with React , TypeScript , and Vite . For rendering the 3D environment, we used the powerful Three.js library, primarily through the declarative APIs of @react-three/fiber and @react-three/drei . Global state management is handled efficiently by Zustand . Backend (Computer Vision): The gesture-control engine is powered by a Python backend using Flask and Eventlet for high-performance WebSocket communication. We use OpenCV to capture the video feed from the user's webcam and the MediaPipe library to perform real-time hand landmark detection. This landmark data is then streamed to the frontend. Backend (AI Agent): The AI assistant is orchestrated by a Node.js server using Express . This server acts as a middleware that defines a set of tools (functions) the AI can use to manipulate the 3D scene. It integrates with LLM providers (like Martian) and the Fal AI API for generative 3D model creation from text prompts.\n\nThe components communicate seamlessly: the Python backend streams hand data to the React frontend via WebSockets, while the frontend sends user prompts to the Node.js server to trigger AI actions."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Building a project this ambitious came with its fair share of hurdles.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges was minimizing latency . For the gesture control to feel natural, the delay between a physical hand movement and the response in the 3D viewport had to be negligible. We spent a significant amount of time optimizing our Python backend, implementing frame-skipping logic and efficient data serialization to ensure the WebSocket connection remained snappy.\n\nAnother difficulty was designing a robust gesture recognition system . Raw hand landmark data from MediaPipe is noisy and varies between users. We had to develop normalization and rotation-invariant processing techniques to translate this raw data into consistent, reliable commands like \"pinch\" or \"grab.\"\n\nFinally, integrating the three distinct parts of our application (Python CV, Node.js AI, and React frontend) was a complex architectural task. Ensuring smooth communication and state synchronization between these services required careful planning and debugging."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are incredibly proud of creating a truly multi-modal interface for 3D creation. The ability to seamlessly switch between direct, physical manipulation with your hands and high-level, abstract commands with your voice is the core of what we wanted to achieve.\n\nThe low-latency performance of the hand-tracking pipeline is a major accomplishment. It feels fluid and responsive, which is crucial for making the experience immersive rather than frustrating.\n\nFurthermore, we developed a comprehensive and powerful toolset for our AI agent . The AI can do more than just create primitives; it can perform complex boolean operations, modify materials, duplicate objects, and even generate entirely new models, giving users immense creative leverage through simple language."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project was a massive learning experience. We learned a great deal about the intricacies of real-time computer vision and the importance of performance optimization at every step of the data pipeline. We also gained a deep appreciation for the complexities of human-computer interaction design , especially when creating novel interfaces that don't rely on established conventions.\n\nOn the AI front, we learned how to effectively design and implement a tool-using AI agent . Defining clear, non-overlapping functions and engineering the system prompts to get reliable, structured output from the LLM was a fascinating challenge that pushed our understanding of applied AI."},{"heading":"What's next for ShapeShift","content":"The future is bright and three-dimensional! We have many ideas for where to take ShapeShift next:\n\nExpanded Gesture Library: We plan to introduce more complex and two-handed gestures for advanced actions like scaling the entire scene, drawing custom shapes, or performing intricate sculpting operations. Multi-User Collaboration: We want to turn ShapeShift into a collaborative space where multiple users can join a session and build together in real-time, seeing each other's virtual hands. AR/VR Integration: The ultimate goal is to break free from the 2D screen entirely. We plan to adapt our interaction model for augmented and virtual reality headsets to create a fully immersive 3D modeling environment. Smarter AI: We will continue to enhance our AI's capabilities, enabling it to understand more complex, multi-step commands and maintain a better contextual awareness of the user's project goals."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"express.js fal flask martian node.js opencv python react rodin vite"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Evident AI","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/evident-ai","tagline":"Automatically transforms bodycam footage into professional evidence reports using AI.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/739/239/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Y Combinator: Unicorn Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"django","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"openai","url":null},{"name":"openai-agents-sdk","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/asalsali/evidentai-main"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Evidence processing is the bottleneck.

However, this power often comes at the cost of complexity. Steep learning curves, cluttered interfaces with hundreds of buttons, and the manual nature of timeline-based editing can feel more like operating heavy machinery than engaging in a a creative act.\n\nWe were inspired by the recent breakthroughs in conversational AI and asked ourselves: What if you could create a video just by describing it?\n\nWe envisioned a tool that would remove the technical barriers and allow creators to focus purely on their vision. Instead of searching through menus to find the \"fade\" effect, you could simply ask:\n\n\"Fade in the title text.\"\n\nInstead of manually scrubbing a timeline to find a scene, you could say:\n\n\"Cut to the part where the rocket launches.\"\n\nThis desire to make video creation as intuitive and fluid as a conversation was the core inspiration for VibeMovie."},{"heading":"🎬 What it does","content":"VibeMovie is an AI-native video editor that turns natural language into a rendered video. It works like a creative partner. A user can start with a raw video file, or even a blank canvas, and direct the entire editing process through a simple chat interface.\n\n💬 Chat-Based Editing\n\nUsers can ask the AI to perform a wide range of editing tasks, such as:\n\n\"Add a title that says 'My Awesome Trip'.\" \"Cut the first 5 seconds of the video.\" \"Put a smooth fade-out effect at the end.\" \"Make the text on screen red and larger.\"\n\n📊 Live Visual Timeline\n\nWhile the user chats with the AI, a dynamic timeline provides a real-time visual representation of the video's structure. Users can see the clips, tracks, and their arrangement as the AI makes changes.\n\n👉 Direct Manipulation\n\nAlthough AI-driven, the interface still allows for direct, hands-on adjustments. Users can drag clips to change their timing, trim their edges, or split them with a double-click.\n\n✨ High-Quality Export\n\nOnce the user is happy with the result, they can click the \"Export\" button to have the entire composition rendered into a high-quality MP4 video, with all the AI-generated edits, effects, and assets included."},{"heading":"🛠️ How We Built It","content":"VibeMovie is architected as a modern monorepo, with a powerful frontend engine that talks to an intelligent backend brain. The entire system is built around a single, declarative principle: video is just data.\n\n🖥️ The Frontend: A Full-Featured Video Editor Engine\n\nWe didn't just build a UI; we engineered a complete video editing engine from the ground up, designed to run entirely in the browser.\n\nThe Core: The interface is built on React . At its heart it is a highly interactive, scalable, and draggable timeline component . This custom component uses @dnd-kit to provide users with the precise, intuitive drag-and-drop editing experience they expect from a professional tool. State Management: State is managed by Zustand . The entire video structure—every clip, text overlay, and transition—lives as a single, predictable JSON object. This is our \"single source of truth.\" Live Preview: We use @remotion/player to provide a frame-accurate, real-time preview. It reads the JSON state directly from Zustand and renders the visual output, giving users instant feedback on every edit.\n\n🧠 The Backend: The AI Director & Render Farm\n\nOur Node.js and Express server acts as the central intelligence and heavy-lifting powerhouse for the editor.\n\nThe AI Bridge: It leverages the Google Gemini API to translate a user's natural language prompts into precise actions. We engineered a sophisticated prompt that teaches the AI how to read the incoming video JSON and rewrite it to apply the requested edits. The Render Engine: On export, the backend transforms into a powerful render farm. It uses @remotion/renderer to programmatically render the final composition into a high-quality MP4 file using a headless Chrome instance.\n\n🌉 The Bridge: Our JSON-to-Video Compiler\n\nThe secret sauce is how we connect everything. The entire video is represented as a declarative JSON object. We built a custom JSON compiler that dynamically maps this data structure into a tree of React components. Remotion then takes these components and renders them, frame by frame, into the final video. This architecture is incredibly powerful: whether the user drags a clip or the AI edits the vibe, they are both just manipulating a simple JSON object."},{"heading":"🚧 Challenges We Overcame","content":"1. Teaching the AI to Edit Video Correctly\n\nTranslating ambiguous human language like \"make this cooler\" into a precise JSON data structure was our biggest hurdle. Getting the AI to consistently output perfectly structured, nested JSON without a single misplaced comma was a massive prompt engineering challenge.\n\nSolution: We developed a multi-layered approach: advanced prompts with few-shot examples, a strict schema definition provided to the AI, and a robust validation layer on our backend to catch and sanitize any malformed AI output before it could break the editor.\n\n2. Building a Performant, Interactive Editing Engine\n\nA video editor needs to feel fluid and instant. Building a performant UI with a draggable, scalable timeline that renders a live preview without lagging was a significant frontend engineering feat, especially as projects became more complex.\n\nSolution: This required a deep focus on React performance, meticulous state management with Zustand to prevent unnecessary re-renders, and leveraging battle-tested libraries like @dnd-kit to handle the complex interactive elements efficiently.\n\n3. Mastering Server-Side Video Rendering\n\nRendering a video on a server requires that the server have access to all the assets. However, blob: URLs for media uploaded in the browser are completely inaccessible to our backend rendering process.\n\nSolution: We engineered an on-demand asset pipeline . Just before rendering, the frontend identifies all local assets and uploads them to our server. The backend then remaps the paths in the JSON structure, ensuring the headless browser can find and composite every file into the final video seamlessly."},{"heading":"🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"A Truly Conversational Interface\n\nWe succeeded in creating an editor where complex actions can be triggered by simple, intuitive language. Watching the AI correctly interpret a command like \"add a title and make it slide in from the bottom\" and then seeing it reflected instantly on the timeline is a magical experience.\n\nThe Hybrid Editing Model\n\nWe're proud of the seamless integration between AI-driven editing and direct manual manipulation. The user is never locked into the AI's choices; they can always fine-tune the results by hand, offering the best of both worlds.\n\nThe Server-Side Rendering Pipeline\n\nBuilding a fully automated, on-demand video rendering service on the backend was a significant technical achievement. It allows for high-quality, reliable exports without freezing the user's browser, which is a common problem with client-side video rendering."},{"heading":"🎓 What we learned","content":"Throughout this project, we learned that the future of creative software lies in abstracting complexity. The most powerful tool isn't necessarily the one with the most features, but the one that provides the most intuitive path from an idea to a result.\n\nRepresenting the entire video as a declarative JSON object was a revelation. It treated the video not as a monolithic file, but as a \"script\" that could be programmatically written, edited, and remixed. This approach makes it incredibly scalable and opens the door for even more powerful AI integrations in the future."},{"heading":"🗺️ What's next for VibeMovie","content":"This hackathon project is just the beginning. We're excited about the potential to expand on this foundation:\n\nAdvanced AI Capabilities: Integrating more sophisticated AI models that can analyze video content (e.g., detecting scenes, identifying objects, generating transcripts) to perform even smarter edits.
