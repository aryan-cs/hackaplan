Our fashionable product consists of a two ultrasonic sensors on a pair of stylish glasses as well as a leather belt. These sensors will trigger a buzzing sound if an obstacle is detected in the path of the individual, thus warning them of potential hazards. The distance of the detected object will change the pitch to allow the user to get a better perception of the distance (meaning that the closer the object, the higher the pitch). Accompanying the distance detectors is a line-following car that can be safely be followed with a string so that the individual can be guided across a complex area. The car is halted by pulling on the string if the individual wishes to stop."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built the body obstacle detector by connecting two ultrasonic sensors to an Arduino and mounting them to safety glasses and a belt. The buzzer, sensors, Arduino and battery are all wearable and independent of external wiring. The car has an Arduino which controls the vehicle's wheels and two Elegoo line detectors which allow it to follow a line. It is able to drive along a strong black line against a white background due to the sensitivity of the dual line detectors."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We initially were planning on using 5 Elegoo obstacle detectors; however, we were only able to obtain two and they weren't functional thus causing us to ultimately use ultrasonic sensors instead. Also, we faced many issues debugging our devices due to problems with random electrical noise, our line detectors not detecting any lines, and general issues constructing the car and the wearable devices."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We made an actual project that we really enjoyed making and playing with after! Even though the plan deviated from our initial plan, we were able to readjust and design a working product with the functionality that we intentionally sought after."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Learn a lot about Arduino (and how not to lose hope when nothing worked)... We also used the 3D printers, crafting tools and plywood at the invention studio for the first time which was a cool and interesting experience since we got to learn what the maker space had to offer. It was a fun day involving some loud signs and confused faces, yet still an overall education, memorial and exciting day."},{"heading":"What's next for 6th Sense","content":"If we ever sought to expand this project, we would likely incorporate better measurement equipment and speaker so that the device could audibly tell the individual which location to go in. It would also be interesting if the scoot moves independent of a black line and assist the user to allow him/her better recognize and avoid nearby obstacles.\n\nThis is the first hackathon for half the team."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino c++ cad elegoo-sensor-kit"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"ROOMBAlling","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/roomballing","tagline":"The SUCKIEST game of bowling known to man.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/772/978/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT presents: BuildGT 2","hackathon_url":"https://buildgt-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"1st Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"a-lot-of-ductape","url":null},{"name":"adobe-illustrator","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/adobe-illustrator"},{"name":"animations","url":null},{"name":"computer-vision","url":null},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"kinect","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/kinect"},{"name":"openkinect","url":null},{"name":"processing","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/processing"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"raspberry-pi","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi"},{"name":"roomba","url":null},{"name":"vacuum","url":null},{"name":"websockets","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/Holben888/roombowling-game-display"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/ArkaneMoose/ROOMBAllingRoombaController"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/athreyaanand/roomballing-pindetection"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Ever wanted to play a nice peaceful game of bowling in the comfort of your own home using your intelligent vacuum cleaner and a couple of water bottles? - yep, us too!

Gather your friends and family to destroy them in your homemade game of bowling, it's time to ROOMBAll!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The project had primarily three elements: the collision detection with the pins, the control of the Roomba, and the translation of real time movement into animation.\n\nThe collision detection was done using Processing (a visual language for Java) and the Kinect. We Jerry-Rigged the top of some typical Kirkland water bottles in order for them to be easily detected by our hoisted Kinect camera; the software program then runs optical image/object recognition to determine where the Roomba is and how many water bottles fall down on any given turn. The way the data is transferred will be discussed later.\n\nThe Roomba itself is controlled by utilizing the pycreate2 library. The collision sensors built into the Roomba allow the user to kick/interact with it; this detection allows the user to lock in the location and angle at which the Roomba will be shot into the pins.\n\nThe translation of realtime into animation was completely created using CSS and javascript. With some sick editing skills, we are able to show amazing strike, spare, and pin knockdown animation.\n\nAll three of these elements were connected / talk to each other using simple websockets and JSON objects. Three separate computers send/receive data to and from a central raspberry pi located on top of the Roomba. This Pi allows for the vehicle to function without being tethered to a physical laptop!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Not too many. Once we figured out the exact technologies we want, all of us split up to do the three distinct elements and came together at the end to tie it all back together!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The ability to take something like a Roomba and turn it into a controller for a game is simply incredible. The simple gratification from creating something and seeing it work in front of your eyes for the first time makes the entire grueling process worth it!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Everything from websockets and CSS animations, to Kinect image recognition and Roomba control was relatively novel to us. We can gladly say that all of us came out of the hackathon a little bit more proficient in a plethora of new libraries that we were eager to tinker with!"},{"heading":"What's next for ROOMBAlling","content":"Multiplayer is something we really wanted to implement but didn't have time to. It would've been crazy fun to play your other friends in a full game of bowling in your own house or apartment! Imagine Wii bowling but in real life!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"a-lot-of-ductape adobe-illustrator animations computer-vision css java javascript kinect openkinect processing python raspberry-pi roomba vacuum websockets"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"L.A.M.P. - Lantern with Automated Music Processing","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/l-a-m-p-lantern-with-automated-music-processing","tagline":"A lantern that reacts to chords in the song currently playing","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT presents: BuildGT 2","hackathon_url":"https://buildgt-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"3rd Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"neopixels","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"tensegrity-structure","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We both have played instruments for many, many years, and are interested in different ways for music to interact for the environment.

The inner structure of the L.A.M.P. is a tensegrity structure, where certain elements (the acrylic) experience only compression and the other elements (thread) experience only tension. The outside is wrapped by an origami fold that makes paper easier to flex to that shape, and gives it a more visually distinct texture. The audio processing runs on an attached laptop that places the song of choice. The laptop directs the Arduino to display certain colors on the LED strip by calculating the chords with various signal processing algorithms. The signal processing is based on a GitHub repo for Python chord recognition, which in turn uses the librosa Python library. Communication to the Arduino is done with pyserial , and the Arduino drives the Neopixel strip with the FastLED library ."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The initial plan was to have the lamp function as a Bluetooth speaker, but due to the lack of time, we reverted to playing audio files directly on a computer. That option ended up with much higher sound quality."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The tensegrity structure at the core of the L.A.M.P. is an interesting mix of thread, which can only act in tension, and acrylic, which easily breaks under tension.
