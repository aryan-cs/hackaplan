With every one in four seniors in the US experiencing a fall each year, attempts at prevention are badly needed and are currently implemented through careful monitoring and caregiving. However, in the age of COVID-19 (and even before), remote caregiving has been a difficult and time-consuming process: caregivers must either rely on updates given by the senior themselves or monitor a video camera or other device 24/7. Tracking day-to-day health and progress is nearly impossible, and maintaining and improving strength and mobility presents unique challenges.\n\nHaving personally experienced this exhausting process in the past, our team decided to create an all-in-one tool that helps prevent such devastating falls from happening and makes remote caregivers' lives easier."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"NoFall enables smart ambient activity monitoring, proactive risk assessments, a mobile alert system, and a web interface to tie everything together.\n\nAmbient activity monitoring\n\nNoFall continuously watches and updates caregivers with the condition of their patient through an online dashboard. The activity section of the dashboard provides the following information:\n\nCurrent action: sitting, standing, not in area, fallen, etc. How many times the patient drank water and took their medicine Graph of activity throughout the day, annotated with key events Histogram of stand-ups per hour Daily activity goals and progress score Alerts for key events\n\nProactive risk assessment\n\nUsing the powerful tools offered by Google Cloud, a proactive risk assessment can be activated with a simple voice query to a smart speaker like Google Home. When starting an assessment, our algorithms begin analyzing the user's movements against a standardized medical testing protocol for screening a patient's risk of falling. The screening consists of two tasks:\n\nTimed Up-and-Go (TUG) test. The user is asked to sit up from a chair and walk 10 feet. The user is timed, and the timer stops when 10 feet has been walked. If the user completes this task in over 12 seconds, the user is said to be of at a high risk of falling. 30-second Chair Stand test: The user is asked to stand up and sit down on a chair repeatedly, as fast as they can, for 30 seconds. If the user not is able to sit down more than 12 times (for females) and 14 times (for males), they are considered to be at a high risk of falling.\n\nThe videos of the tests are recorded and can be rewatched on the dashboard. The caregiver can also view the results of tests in the dashboard in a graph as a function of time.\n\nMobile alert system\n\nWhen the user is in a fallen state, a warning message is displayed in the dashboard and texted using SMS to the assigned caregiver's phone."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Frontend\n\nThe frontend was built using React and styled using TailwindCSS. All data is updated from Firestore in real time using listeners, and new activity and assessment goals are also instantly saved to the cloud.\n\nAlerts are also instantly delivered to the web dashboard and caretakers' phones using IFTTT's SMS Action.\n\nWe created voice assistant functionality through Amazon Alexa skills and Google home routines. A voice command triggers an IFTTT webhook, which posts to our Flask backend API and starts risk assessments.\n\nBackend\n\nModel determination and validation\n\nTo determine the pose of the user, we utilized Google's MediaPipe library in Python. We decided to use the BlazePose model, which is lightweight and can run on real-time security camera footage. The BlazePose model is able to determine the pixel location of 33 landmarks of the body, corresponding to the hips, shoulders, arms, face, etc. given a 2D picture of interest. We connected the real-time streaming from the security camera footage to continuously feed frames into the BlazePose model. Our testing confirmed the ability of the model to determine landmarks despite occlusion and different angles, which would be commonplace when used on real security camera footage.\n\nAmbient sitting, standing, and falling detection\n\nTo determine if the user is sitting or standing, we calculated the angle that the knees make with the hips and set a threshold, where angles (measured from the horizontal) less than that number are considered sitting. To account for the angle where the user is directly facing the camera, we also determined the ratio of the hip-to knee length to the hip-to-shoulder length, reasoning that the 2D landmarks of the knees would be closer to the body when the user is sitting. To determine the fallen status, we determined if the center of the shoulders and the center of the knees made an angle less than 45 degrees for over 20 frames at once. If the legs made an angle greater than a certain threshold (close to 90 degrees), we considered the user to be standing. Lastly, if there was no detection of landmarks, we considered the status to be unknown (the user may have left the room/area). Because of the different possible angles of the camera, we also determined the perspective of the camera based on the convergence of straight lines (the straight lines are determined by a Hough transformation algorithm). The convergence can indicate how angled the camera is, and the thresholds for the ratio of lengths can be mathematically transformed accordingly.\n\nProactive risk assessment analysis\n\nTo analyze timed up-and-go tests, we first determined if the user is able to change his or her status from sitting to standing, and then determined the distance the user has traveled by determining the speed from finite difference calculation of the velocity from the previous frame. The pixel distance was then transformed based on the distance between the user's eyes and the height of the user (which is pre-entered in our website) to determine the real-world distance the user has traveled. Once the user reaches 10 meters cumulative distance traveled, the timer stops and is reported to the server.\n\nTo analyze 30-second chair stand tests, the number of transitions between sitting and standing were counted. Once 30 seconds has been reached, the number of times the user sat down is half of the number of transitions, and the data is sent to the server."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Figuring out port forwarding with barebones IP camera, then streaming the video to the world wide web for consumption by our model.

Limitations in gesture recognition. Similar gestures that involve crossing fingers (ASL letters M vs. N) were limited by Oculus' finger tracking system in differential recognition. Accuracy in finger tracking will continue to improve, and we're excited to see the capabilities that could bring to our game.\n\n2. Differences in hardware. Three out of four of our team members either own a PC with a graphics card or an Oculus headset. Since both are necessary to debug live in Unity, the differences in hardware made it difficult for us to initially get set up by downloading the necessary packages and get our software versions in sync.\n\n3. Lack of face tracking. ASL requires signers to make facial expressions while signing which we unfortunately cannot track with current hardware. The Tobii headset, as well as Valve's next VR headset both plan to include eye tracking so with the increased focus on facial tracking in future VR headsets we would better be able to judge signs from users."},{"heading":"Accomplishments We're Proud Of","content":"We're very proud of successfully integrating multiple artistic visions into one project.

And while it holds true, this is an oversimplification: the number of lives saved is dependent not only on the quantity, but also on the quality of the masks which people wear (as evidenced by recent research by the CDC). However, due to an insufficient supply of N95 masks, healthcare workers are forced to wear cloth or surgical masks which both leak from the sides, increasing the risk of infection, and are arduous to breathe through for extended physical exertion."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Maskus is the first mask bracket and fitter in one - custom-fitted and printed using accessible technology. It is designed to improve the baseline quality of facemasks around the world, with its first and most pressing use is for healthcare workers. The user starts taking a picture of their face through their computer/smartphone camera. We then generate an accurate 3D representation of the user's face and design a tight-fitting 3D printable mask bracket specifically tailored to the user's face contours. Within seconds, we can render the user's custom mask onto the user's face in augmented reality in realtime. The user can then either download their custom mask in a format ready for 3D printing, or set up software to print the mask automatically. We also have an Arduino Nano that alerts the user if the mask is secured properly, or letting them now it needs to be readjusted."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"After the user visits the Maskus website, our React frontend sends a POST request to a Python Flask backend. The server receives the image, decodes it, and feeds it into a state of the art machine learning 3D face reconstruction model (3DDFA). The resultant 3D face model then goes through some preprocessing, which compresses the 3D data to improve performance. Another script then extracts the user's face contour/outline from the 3D model and builds a custom mask bracket with programmable CAD software. On the web app, the user gets to see both their own 3D face mesh as well as an AR rendering of the custom fitted mask onto their face (using React and three.js). Lastly, this data is saved to a standard 3D printing file format (.obj) and returned to the user so they can print it wherever they like. In terms of our hardware, the mask's alert system comprises of an Arduino Nano with a piezo buzzer and two push buttons (left and right side of face) wired in series. In order to get the push buttons to engage when the mask is worn, we created custom 3D parts that create a larger area for the buttons to be pushed."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This project was touched many disciplines, and posed many difficulties. We were determined to provide the user with the ability to see how their mask would fit them in real time using AR. In order to do this, we needed a way to visualize 3D models in the web. This proved difficult due to many misleading resources and weak documentation. Simple things (like figuring out how to get a 3D model to stop rotating) took much longer than they should have, simply because the frameworks were obfuscated. AR was also very difficult to implement, particularly due to the fact that it is a new technology and the existing frameworks for it are not yet mature. Our project is one of the first we've seen placing 3D models (not images) onto user faces."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"From the machine learning side of the project, 3D face reconstruction is a very difficult problem. Luckily, our team was able to succesfully implement and use the 3DDFA state of the art machine learning model for face reconstruction. Installing and configuring the neccessary Python packages and virtual environments posed a challenge at the start, but we were able to quickly overcome this and get a working machine learning pipeline. Being able to solve this problem early on in the hackathon gave our team more time to focus on other problems, such as web 3D model visualization and constructing the facemask from our 3D face model."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Amusingly, during this project we found that things which were supposed to be difficult turned out to be easy to implement and, conversely, the easy parts turned out to be hard. Things like front end design and integrating web frameworks turned out to be some of the most challenging parts of the project, whereas things like machine learning were easier than expected. A takeaway is that the feasibility of quickly building a project should be based not only on the difficulty of the task, but also on the quality of existing resources which can be used to build it. Good frameworks make implementing difficult projects much easier."},{"heading":"What's next for Maskus","content":"Aside from refactoring the code and improving webpage design, we see several things for the project going forward. Perhaps the biggest points is developing a reliable algorithm to extract the facemask outline from a 3D face model. The one the group currently has works most of the time, but serves as the bottleneck of the system in terms of facial recognition accuracy. The UI design can be improved as well. Lastly, threeJS was found to be a pain, especially when trying to integrate it with React. It would be worth exploring simpler JavaScript frameworks. We would also love to add more functionality to the Arduino in the future, making it a 'smarter' mask. We hope to add sensors like AQS (Air Quality Sensor), creating alerts if the mask has been worn too long and needs to be replaced, and status LEDs in order to visually tell your mask is secure.\n\nIn terms of future growth, Markus can comfortably be deployed as a web app and used by healthcare workers around the world in order to decrease risk of COVID transmission. It is a low cost solution designed to work with existing masks and improve upon them. Opening up the software to open source contribution is a potential way to grow, and we hope it would lead to very fast progress."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino cura google-cloud javascript python pythonocc pytorch react solidworks three.js trimesh"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com maskfit.verafy.me"}]},{"project_title":"BlockFund","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/blockfund","tagline":"A decentralised autonomous organisation (DAO), that pools community funds, engage the community, and allow transparent voting on blockchain.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/396/136/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2021","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2021.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most Impactful Hack"},{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2021","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2021.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Alchemy] Best Hack using Alchemy API and Developer Tools"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"blockchain","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blockchain"},{"name":"esri","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri"},{"name":"ethereum","url":null},{"name":"openai","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react.js","url":null},{"name":"solidity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/solidity"}],"external_links":[{"label":"rinkeby.kelas.dev","url":"https://rinkeby.kelas.dev"},{"label":"xdai.kelas.dev","url":"https://xdai.kelas.dev"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"See our live demo!","content":"On Rinkeby testnet blockchain (recommended): https://rinkeby.kelas.dev\n\nOn xDAI blockchain (Warning: uses real money): https://xdai.kelas.dev"},{"heading":"Check out our narrative StoryMaps here!","content":"Greenery in your Community: https://arcg.is/1vu448\n\nCulture & Diversity in choosing your Home: https://arcg.is/DH511"},{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"BlockFund's mission is to build a platform to empower communities with tools and data. We aim to improve outcomes in community civic engagement and community sustainability.\n\nHow we do so, BlockFund:\n\nDemocratises community funds through blockchain and voting technology - allowing community members to submit their own project proposals and vote. Highlights the need for community environment sustainability projects through identifying local areas lacking in tree foliage. Importantly, we educate the community through a narrative in an ArcGIS StoryMap. Image processing and deep learning science enables the identification of even smallest tree's foliage. TeamTreesMini Aids potential new residents-to-be and migrants in looking for home (and community) that fits their unique culture heritage, beliefs and diversity needs, through outlining demographic breakdowns, religious institutions, and ammenities. Also educating the importance and factors to consider through a narrative in an ArcGIS StoryMap.\n\n1. Democratises community funds through blockchain and voting technology In the US, Homeowner Associations (HOA) are the main medium in which residents members pay community upkeep fees to maintain grounds, master insurance, community utilities, as well as overall community finances. Financial Transparency varies between HOAs, but often they only reflect past fund usage and the choices of a few representative members. We sought a solution that democratises the funding of projects process – allowing residents to contribute and vote for projects that actually matter to them. It's easy for community minorities to go unheard, so our voting system helps to account for that. We adjust and increase the voting weight of residents whose vote has not funded a successful project after a few attempts – thus improving the representation of minorities in any community.\n\n2. Highlights the need for environment sustainability projects #TeamTreesMini Additionally, we empower communities to engage in green urban planning. We mimic #TeamTrees on a communal scale. Climate change is an increasingly prevalent topic, and we believe illustrating the dangers in your backyard is an excellent way to encourage local action. Our StoryMap solution maps the green foliage coverage in your neighbourhood. Then, we empower the community in proposing projects on the platform to fund tree planting in each home and in common areas.\n\n3. Your home, why Cultural Fit and Diversity matters After a community profile is made, we also assist new members in choosing a community aligned with their cultural, religious and diversity interests. When one of our members moved to a different and largely skewed racial group neighbourhood, he faced both explicit and subtle racism growing up. Home seekers already take demographics into consideration, and our solution empowers aids home seekers in making a more informed decision from a cultural perspective. It also can support urban planning for community planners. We map diversity index scores, demographic data (generational and race), and the religious institutions and ammenities – aiding new home seekers in choosing their home.\n\nThe proverb \"Birds of a feather flock together\" describes how those of similar taste congregate in groups. However, in our world today, the importance of diversity and exposing oneself to different opinions and people is crucial to thrive in the workforce.\n\nDiversity is having a seat at the table. Inclusion is having a voice.

We sought to remedy these issues by creating Upright."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Upright uses your laptop's camera to analyze and help you improve your posture. Register and calibrate the system in less than two minutes, and simply keep Upright open in the background and continue working. Upright will notify you if you begin to slouch so you can correct it. Upright also has the Upright companion iOS app to view your daily metrics.\n\nSome notable features include:\n\nSmart slouch detection with ML Little overhead - get started in < 2 min Native notifications on any platform Progress tracking with an iOS companion app"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We created Upright’s desktop app using Electron.js, an npm package used to develop cross-platform apps. We created the individual pages for the app using HTML, CSS, and client-side JavaScript. For the onboarding screens, users fill out an HTML form which signs them in using Firebase Authentication and uploads information such as their name and preferences to Firestore. This data is also persisted locally using NeDB, a local JavaScript database. The menu bar addition incorporates a camera through a MediaDevices web API, which gives us frames of the user’s posture. Using Tensorflow’s PoseNet model, we analyzed these frames to determine if the user is slouching and if so, by how much. The app sends a desktop notification to alert the user about their posture and also uploads this data to Firestore. Lastly, our SwiftUI-based iOS app pulls this data to display metrics and graphs for the user about their posture over time."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We faced difficulties when managing data throughout the platform, from the desktop app backend to the frontend pages to the iOS app. As this was our first time using Electron, our team spent a lot of time discovering ways to pass data safely and efficiently, discussing the pros and cons of different solutions. Another significant challenge was performing the machine learning on the video frames. The task of taking in a stream of camera frames and outputting them into slouching percentage values was quite demanding, but we were able to overcome several bugs and obstacles along the way to create the final product."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re proud that we’ve come up with a seamless and beautiful design that takes less than a minute to setup. The slouch detection model is also pretty accurate, something that we’re pretty proud of. Overall, we’ve built a robust system that we believe outperforms other solutions using just the webcamera of your computer, while also integrating features to track slouching data on your mobile device."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project taught us how to combine multiple complicated moving pieces into one application. Specifically, we learned how to make a native desktop application with features like notifications built-in using Electron. We also learned how to connect our backend posture data with Firestore to relay information from our Electron application to our OS app. Lastly, we learned how to integrate a machine learning model in Tensorflow within our Electron application."},{"heading":"What's next for Upright","content":"The next step is improving the posture detection model with more training data, tailored for each user. While the posture detection model we currently use is pretty accurate, by using more custom-tailored training data, it would take Upright to the next level.

Throughout human history, birds have long been a bellwether for a wide range of environmental phenomena, ranging from everyday weather to brewing environmental catastrophe. With their wide-ranging habitats and lengthy migratory patterns, birds are often exposed to a much larger cross-section of the ecosystem than many other animals, and reside high enough in the food chain that they can be adversely impacted by environmental contamination in ways that other species are not.\n\nMonitoring the everyday patterns and reproductive lifecycle of birds across the ecological spectrum can provide essential data for understanding the true health of our ecosystem.\n\nToday, some efforts have been made to conduct prolonged, distributed studies of birds across the world, but these labor-intensive studies are naturally limited in scope and effectiveness, as they involve volunteers carefully walking or hiking to nests multiple times a day to make observations. Modern IoT technology makes it possible to automate and widely expand these essential studies in a manner that involves and educates local communities across the world--an opportunity that Canary was built to fulfill."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Canary is a low-cost automatic wildlife observation system, designed as an educational kit for students, bird enthusiasts, and researchers. Each Canary base station contains a high-definition camera with day and night vision capability (including infrared illuminators that are invisible to birds), an array of attachable sensors like thermocouples and strain gauges, and a web server that streams video and automatically gathered statistics to users on a local area network. Canary is intended to be mounted to the roof of a nesting box, birdhouse, or other observation site, and continuously captures video and other data from its feathered companions. Video and sensor data is processed on-board Canary in order to extract relevant events and summary statistics. At the micro scale, this means that users can play back amazing bird moments they may have missed, and view the history of the bird family building its life in their own yard. At the macro scale, distilling hundreds of hours of video into concise summary statistics and relevant video frames allows researchers to keep tabs on large populations of birds without consuming large amounts of bandwidth or cloud computing resources.\n\nCanary is designed from the ground-up to be a plug-and-play solution that is extremely accessible to consumers and students.\n\nThe device runs on Power Over Ethernet (PoE), requiring only a single outdoor-rated Ethernet cable (easily had at your local Home Depot) for both its data and power connections. Once Canary is connected to a user's Local Area Network, no further configuration is required! Anyone on the network can view the video stream and other webpages in their internet browser, and if an Internet connection is available (and the user opts in), Canary will forward summary statistics and a small subset of images to the cloud to be added to public research data. With IP65 waterproofing on all of its components, Canary is built to last in an outdoor environment for years, in climate conditions across the globe.\n\nAdding an IoT device to one's personal space can raise privacy concerns, even outdoors. Canary respects users' privacy by design. Canary base stations have no integrated GPS, and instead derive rough location data from their IP address, thereby limiting the ability to pinpoint users' locations from publicly available datasets. Additionally, Canary base stations are intended to be mounted to an enclosed observation space with only an internal field of view, thereby reducing the possibility of unwanted backyard video recordings."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Canary's hardware is built around a Raspberry Pi 4 single board computer that runs all of its data acquisition, web services, and data processing. A CSI camera module with infrared illuminators was used as the video capture device, and two waterproof thermocouples allow continuous measurement of temperature inside and outside the attached birdhouse. A PoE hat provides power to the Raspberry pi over the attached Cat5e ethernet cable, which is routed through a window with a flat cable and attached to a PoE Ethernet switch indoors. Canary is assembled into an inexpensive and compact waterproof case with the use of a 3d-printed bracket that allows the camera module to be stacked beneath the other electronics. The whole enclosure is intended to fit atop a birdhouse we built with these plans from Lowe's , which requires only a single wooden board, nails, and some glue. External electrical connections are gasketed and properly strain relieved with the use of cable glands, ensuring environmental robustness and a long service life.\n\nCanary's software stack is built on top of a data processing pipeline written in Python, which collects data and performs inference to capture relevant events and distill summary statistics. This pipeline writes video frames and sensor data into a REDIS key-value store, that acts as an inter-process communication layer between the Python backend and the web server, which is written in Node.js using the Express framework. While it adds some amount of overhead in inter-process communication requirements, utilizing a Python data pipeline allows the use of an unrivaled scientific computing ecosystem through packages like numpy, OpenCV, Pytorch, Tensorflow, scipy, and the like.\n\nThe Express server pulls video frames and data from the REDIS server and uses them to populate information in web pages that it serves to the user. Streamed, high-frequency data like the video feed and temperature recordings are emitted via SocketIO websockets, allowing users to see a live feed of values and images being recorded in real time.\n\nClient-side webpages are coded in Node.js, with template generation using Jade/Pug and styling using CSS.\n\nCanary makes extensive use of the Esri API and features in order to visualize huge amounts of real bird data. Although Canary has not yet gathered any real nesting or bird sighting data, efforts such as NestWatch and iNaturalist have made some datasets available to the public. These datasets were processed and integrated, and then combined with a hosted a custom feature layer on Esri in order to create a large, interactive map of bird sightings. Additionally, Esri's capability to do SQL querying on a feature layer was utilized to enable users to highlight specific bird species, allowing them to better understand which nesting species might be present in their area. This knowledge is essential for constructing a good nesting enclosure, as many different species of birds have different requirements for a healthy nesting enclosure ."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This was our group's first big project using Javascript, and there was a steep learning curve for setting up a webserver and getting it to serve content. We were more familiar with Python, but had not used REDIS before, and faced another set of hurdles in attempting to connect our backend data pipeline with our \"frontend\" Express server--and then yet another set of hurdles in attempting to connect our \"frontend\" server with the local web clients on users' machines. Many hours were spent publishing data to the wrong keys in REDIS, editing webpages without realizing that our local browsers hadn't emptied their caches and weren't reflecting changes, and combing through mountains of documentation to find the Node packages we needed. The Node.js package ecosystem is seemingly infinite, which is very much a double-edged sword. There is a package for everything, but sometimes adding a package just makes things more complicated."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As of the writing of this devpost entry, everything works!

Soil would fall in the middle and the ranges in moisture were defined by the pure air and pure water boundaries.\n\nFrom there, we visualized the hardware set up with the sensor connected to an Arduino UNO microcontroller connected to a Raspberry Pi 4 controlling a solenoid valve that releases water when the soil moisture meter is less than 40% wet."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"At first, we aimed too high.

Not all plants are appropriate for all locations so we would want to provide the user with options for optimal planting. We can use software like ArcScene to look at sunlight exposure according to regional 3D topographical images and suggest planting locations and times.\n\nWe want our product to be user friendly, so we want to improve our aesthetics and show more information about soil moisture beyond just notifying water dispensing."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino openweathermap python raspberry-pi"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com youtu.be"}]},{"project_title":"Lorax.ly","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/lorax-ai","tagline":"We speak for the trees.

This was a necessary concern because we knew we would be using the Esri ArcGIS API with a visualization of the globe (which is and it would become quite slow if the Javascript framework that we used took up too much memory). We then worked on getting the Esri ArcGIS SceneView for the globe working, we used a custom basemap from NASA that showed the cities of the world at night to create a pleasing aesthetic.\n\nWe wrote code to calculate a geodesic around the Earth that spans between the user's current location and where they click, but then interpolates the elevation over time to create an arc around the world.\n\nThen we worked on the Firebase Firestore integration where you can send a message to any geopoint on click. Then we had to create the paper airplanes for each message based on their timestamp created and timestamp for when they should arrive at their destination. Clientside we interpolate between the start and end locations to create the positions of each airplane, and then every timestep: move them toward their destinations by changing the geometry of each graphic in their GraphicsLayer.\n\nIn order to get the news at a specific location, we created an algorithm to scrape Google News for a search query related to that specific location. We developed this using Node.js & Express.js and hosted this as a separate web service. The front end calls our news api whenever the user clicks on a location on the globe. The api then finds all news articles relevant to the location and serves it back to the front end."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The hardest parts of the frontend of this project include creating the arcs that span the earth whenever you click a new position. We had to do a lot of math to figure out that we could trim a part of a geodesic (great circle) of the earth, and then construct a 3d polyline that interpolated each vertex's elevation by its distance to the target destination to form an arc shape.\n\nAnother challenge was the creative use of the Esri ArcGIS API for creating the moving paper airplanes. The GraphicsLayers aren't supposed to be moving, but we needed them to for this project, and we accomplished that efficiently by, on creation time (when sending to firestore), calculating the heading of each paper airplane, and then on each frame, adding that heading to its geometry (position) each frame multiplied by the speed calculated from the difference of its start and arrival times. With that code we were able to create the airplanes orbiting Earth.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was running the news search. Most existing news apis we found only have the option to report news by country. In order to get a more detailed view of local news by city, we ended up scraping google news search for our articles. Our implementation uses puppeteer (opening up Chromium), so we could not run this in the browser along with our other front-end code.

Interruptions of the nursing staff is an issue that is not given priority, though it can have disastrous consequences on the running of the hospital. Interruptions have adverse effects on a nurse’s memory; therefore, interruptions take focus away from the current task. Frequent interruptions can tax a nurse’s cognition load developing a higher risk of committing human error in critical medical procedures.\n\nMany communication interruptions could have been mitigated through more accessible information systems between patients and their medical staff.

With the rapid development and quality of deepfakes, images will likely act as a prime source of disinformation in the years ahead."},{"heading":"How we built it:","content":"We translated our original Node.js backend to Django and built our blockchain in Python, which we then unified with a React frontend to upload files and receive responses from our server."},{"heading":"What it does:","content":"We thought that blockchain was an ideal candidate for implementing a solution to this problem, since it provides a basis for trust in decentralized, peer-to-peer networks. With some deliberation, we landed on the idea of using a blockchain to keep a record of original media content, so that tampering, deepfakes, and edited/photoshopped files can be easily spotted.\n\nJournalists or other users who want to prove that their original photos are unedited/untampered/not-deepfaked can add their images to our service, which we named TrustChain. Information about those images are stored as new blocks in a blockchain. This means that this information cannot easily be tampered with and some level of trust is guaranteed.\n\nCitizens who aren’t sure whether a certain image is trustworthy (e.g. they suspect the image might be edited, deepfaked, etc.) can check that image against our blockchain. Based on what images other users have already put into TrustChain, we’ll return a list of similar images that already exist as blocks within our blockchain, along with their hashes and timestamps. A citizen can then review this log of information, comparing their suspicious image with a history of similar images that we provide. The original unedited image would be recorded on the blockchain first, so if users’ image matches the image in our system that comes first chronologically, the user can be confident that the image is trustworthy.\n\nLet’s look at how exactly we can identify similar images within the blockchain. After a user chooses to put an image into the blockchain, we then store a record of that image and a timestamp as a new block in our blockchain. We also store two hashes of the image in the block.\n\nThe first of the two hashes we store can be thought of as a “general” hash. Without going into too much detail of how it is generated, this “general” hash is identical or very similar for images which are similar to one another. It essentially places similar images into similar hash buckets, so we have a concise way of determining whether two images are similar.\n\nThe second hash amplifies minute differences between images, so we can quickly tell if there are small differences between the two files. Even if two images differ only by a single pixel their second hashes will be different from each other.\n\nThese two types of hashes allow us to compare uploaded images with images already in our blockchain, providing the basis for the comparison functionality described above."},{"heading":"What we learned:","content":"We learned a lot about the feasibility of different hacks in our ideation process, and about the technical promises and limitations of hashing as we were building our blockchain.\n\nWe also each chose tasks that allowed us to learn a new tech stack or skill set, and we traded knowledge on our individual areas of proficiency."},{"heading":"Challenges:","content":"Most of the challenges we faced had to do with learning new technologies. Every single team member had to work with frameworks, concepts, and languages that they hadn’t ever used before. It was difficult to take our new knowledge and put it to use, but ultimately that’s what makes hackathons fun in the first place.\n\nOur biggest challenge, though, was the innate need for food and sleep. We wish we didn’t need rest and could add a couple more features to TrustChain, but unfortunately, we’re only human."},{"heading":"Where we take it from here:","content":"In the future, we plan to make TrustChain truly peer-to-peer. This means that TrustChain users around the world would have their own copies of the blockchain that they can independently verify. All this adds an additional layer of trust because users will no longer have to rely on a single, centralized blockchain where all records are stored.

As a donor, you can sign up to donate addresses either manually or via CSV, and later view the addresses you donated and the individuals matched with them in a dashboard.\n\nPart 2: Receiving an address\n\nTo mitigate security concerns and provide more accessible resources, Paper Homes will be partnering with California homeless shelters under the “Paper Homes” program. We will communicate with shelter staff to help facilitate the matching process and ensure operations run smoothly.\n\nWhen signing up, a homeless individual can provide ID, however if they don’t have any forms of ID we facilitate the entire process in getting them an ID with pre-filled forms for application. Afterwards, they immediately get matched with a donated address! They can then access a dashboard with any documents (i.e. applying for a birth certificate, SSN, California ID Card, registering address with the government - all of which are free in California). During onboarding they can also set up mail forwarding ($1/year, funded by NPO grants and donations) to the homeless shelter they are associated with.\n\nNote: We are solely providing addresses for people, not a place to live.

As each state has their own laws with how they deal with handing out ID and government benefits, there is still a lot of work ahead for Paper Homes!"},{"heading":"Ethics ⚖","content":"In California alone, there are over 150,000 people experiencing homelessness. These people will find it significantly harder to find employment, receive government benefits, even vote without proper identification. The biggest hurdle is that many of these services are linked to an address, and since they do not have a permanent address that they can send mail to, they are locked out of these essential services. We believe that it is ethically wrong for us as a society to not act against the problem of the hole that the US government systems have put in place to make it almost impossible to escape homelessness. And this is not a small problem. An address is no longer just a location - it's now a de facto means of identification. If a person becomes homeless they are cut off from the basic services they need to recover.\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness also encounter other difficulties. Getting your first piece of ID is notoriously hard because most ID’s require an existing form of ID. In California, there are new laws to help with this problem, but they are new and not widely known. While these laws do reduce the barriers to get an ID, without knowing the processes, having the right forms, and getting the right signatures from the right people, it can take over 2 years to get an ID.\n\nPaper Homes attempts to solve these problems by providing a method for people to obtain essential pieces of ID, along with allowing people to receive a proxy address to use.\n\nAs of the 2018 census, there are 1.2 million vacant houses in California. Our platform allows for donors with vacant properties to allow people experiencing homelessness to put down their address to receive government benefits and other necessities that we take for granted. With the donated address, we set up mail forwarding with USPS to forward their mail from this donated address to a homeless shelter near them.\n\nWith proper identification and a permanent address, people experiencing homelessness can now vote, apply for government benefits, and apply for jobs, greatly increasing their chance of finding stability and recovering from this period of instability\n\nPaper Homes unlocks access to the services needed to recover from homelessness. They will be able to open a bank account, receive mail, see a doctor, use libraries, get benefits, and apply for jobs.\n\nHowever, we recognize the need to protect a person’s data and acknowledge that the use of an online platform makes this difficult. Additionally, while over 80% of people experiencing homelessness have access to a smartphone, access to this platform is still somewhat limited. Nevertheless, we believe that a free and highly effective platform could bring a large amount of benefit. So long that we prioritize the needs of a person experiencing homelessness first, we will able to greatly help them rather than harming them.\n\nThere are some ethical considerations that still need to be explored:\n\nWe must ensure that each user’s information security and confidentiality are of the highest importance. Given that we will be storing sensitive and confidential information about the user’s identity, this is top of mind. Without it, the benefit that our platform provides is offset by the damage to their security. Therefore, we will be keeping user data 100% confidential when receiving and storing by using hashing techniques, encryption, etc.\n\nSecondly, as mentioned previously, while this will unlock access to services needed to recover from homelessness, there are some segments of the overall population that will not be able to access these services due to limited access to the internet. While we currently have focused the product on California, US where access to the internet is relatively high (80% of people facing homelessness have access to a smartphone and free wifi is common), there are other states and countries that are limited.\n\nIn addition to the ideas mentioned above, some next steps would be to design a proper user and donor consent form and agreement that both supports users’ rights and removes any concern about the confidentiality of the data. Our goal is to provide means for people facing homelessness to receive the resources they need to recover and thus should be as transparent as possible."},{"heading":"Sources","content":"1\n\n2\n\n3"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css figma firebase html javascript node.js react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"All-In","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/all-in","tagline":"Find the all-in cost of your dream home","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/001/392/971/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2021","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2021.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Landis] Hack most beneficial to aspiring homeowners"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"zillow","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/zillow"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/cathyhou/TreeHacks-all-in"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As our team nears the point in our lives in which buying our first home is on our radar, we've realized how cumbersome and daunting the task is, especially for new homeowners.

The background script keeps track of the tab updates and activations, and this live information is sent to the backend. The Angular App retrieves the list of friends and other users online and displays it on to the chrome extension. For friends, the title of the page they are currently reading is displayed. For users that are not friends, only those who are on the same web page are displayed. For each user displayed on the Chrome extension, we can start a chat. Then, the list view is changed to a chat room where users can have a discussion.\n\nInstead of maintaining our own server, we used Firebase extensively. The live connections are managed by Realtime Database. Yet, since Firestore is easier to work with, we use Cloud Function to reflect the changes of live usage to Firestore using Cloud Function. Thus, there is a ‘status’ collection that contains live information about the connection state and the url and page title each user is looking at. The friends relations are maintained with ‘friends’ collection. We use Firechat, which is an open-source realtime chatting app using Firebase. Thus, all the chatting activities and histories are saved in the chats collection.\n\nOne interesting collection is the ‘feature’ collection. It stores the feature vector, which is an array of 256 numbers, for each user. Whenever a user visits a new page (in the future we plan to change the feature vector update criterion), a Cloud Function is triggered, and using our model, the feature vector is updated. The feature vector is used to find better matches i.e. people that would have similar interests among friends and other users using PageChat. As more data is accumulated, the curated list of people users would want to talk to would improve.\n\nUser Recommendations\n\nIf several people are browsing the same website and want to chat with each other, how do we pair them up? Intuitively, people who have similar browsing histories will have more in common to talk about, so we should group them together. We maintain a dynamic feature vector for each user, which is based off of their reading history. We want feature vectors with small cosine distance to be similar.\n\nWhen is active on PageChat and visits a site on our whitelist (we don't want sites with generic titles, so we stick to mostly news sites), we obtain the title of the page. We make the assumption that the title is representative of the content our user is reading. For example, we would expect that \"27 Extremely Disturbing Wikipedia Pages That Will Haunt Your Dreams\" has different content from \"Ethnography Museum of Ankara\". To obtain a reasonable embedding of our title, we use SBERT , a BERT-based language model trained to predict the representation of sentences. SBERT can attend to the salient keywords in each title and can obtain a global representation of the title.\n\nNext, we need some way to update feature vectors whenever a user visits a new page. This is well-suited for a recurrent neural network. These models maintain a hidden state that is continually updated with each new query. We will use an LSTM to update our feature vectors. It takes in the previous feature vector and new title and outputs the new feature vector.\n\nFinally, we need to train our LSTM. Fortunately, UCI has released a dataset of news headlines along with their respective category (business, science and technology, entertainment, health). We feed these headlines as training data for the model. Before training, we preprocess the headlines, embedding all of them with SBERT. This greatly reduces training times. We use the following three-step procedure to train the model:\n\nTrain an autoencoder to learn a compressed representation of the feature title. SBERT outputs features vectors with 768 elements, which is large and unwieldy. An autoencoder is an unsupervised learning model that is able to learn high-fidelity compressed representations of the input sequence. The encoder (an LSTM) encodes a sequence of headlines into a lower-dimensional (128) space and the decoder (another LSTM) decodes the sequence. The model's goal is to output a sequence as close as possible to the original input sequence. After training, we will end up with an encoder LSTM that is able to faithfully map 768 element input vector to a 128 element space and maintain the information of the representation. We use a contractive autoencoder , which adds an extra loss term to promote the encoder to be less sensitive to variance in the input. Train the encoder to condense feature vectors that share a category. Suppose that Holo reads several business articles and Lawrence also reads several business articles. Ideally, they should have similar feature vectors. To train, we build sequences of 5 headlines, where each headline in a sequence is drawn from the same category. The encoder LSTM from the previous step encodes these sequences to feature vectors. We train it to obtain a higher cosine similarity for vectors that share a category than for vectors that don't. Train the encoder to condense feature vectors that share a story. The dataset also has a feature corresponding to the specific news story an article covers. Similar to step 2, we build sequences of 5 headlines, where each headline in a sequence is drawn from the same story. By training the encoder to predict a high cosine similarity for vectors that share a story, we further improve the representation of the feature vectors.\n\nWe provide some evaluations for our model and document our training process in this Google notebook .

This ‘topic whiplash’ causes a viewer to disengage: how could I care about pumpkin pie when the capitol is being stormed? (Or alternatively, why would I worry about politics when I can enjoy pumpkin pie?)\n\nSecond, a single-column format loses the forest for the trees—it fails to illustrate the bigger picture.

TVD can be applied to any document-based dataset, from legal documents to social media posts to research papers. (Actually, we’ve already begun experimenting with visualizing ArXiv papers.) Because the opportunities for expansion and improvement are huge, the first next step is streamlining the data visualization and adding more customization and filters for the user. Next, it would be to expand the storage and data collection capabilities of the app such as database support and a more efficient web server to keep up with the backend and large volume of incoming information.\n\nNote: For privacy reasons (API keys and passwords), we cannot put our repo here!

But demand for organs has outstripped supply, creating an underground market for illicitly obtained organs. Desperate situations of both recipients and donors create an avenue ready for exploitation by international organ trafficking syndicates. Traffickers exploit the desperation of donors to improve the economic situation of themselves and their families, and they exploit the desperation of recipients who may have few other options to improve or prolong their lives. Like other victims of trafficking in persons, those who fall prey to traffickers for the purpose of organ removal may be vulnerable by virtue of poverty, for instance. Organ trafficking is more than a $5B market annually.\n\nDonSafe sets out to try to solve the primary problems with organ donation and transplantation as described."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"DonSafe has a three way clientele system, and utilises machine learning to first match donors and recipients at scale, anywhere in the world, followed by Stacks blockchain, which is used to securely authenticate organ transfers, including securing the identities and use-case of the donor, recipient and transplant organisation:\n\n1) Donor : Simply set up a user account, and list organ to donate, with personal details about the donor and organ, all authenticated on the Stacks blockchain. The app uses machine learning to determine the authenticity of the listing, and make sure it is ethically sourced .\n\n2) Middle/Transplant organisation : Takes the listing and is in charge of the transplant, usually a hospital.\n\n3) Recipient : Simply set up a user account, and list organ to receive, and a timeline, with personal details about the recipient and organ, all authenticated on the Stacks blockchain. Further verification is done on the part of the health institution. The app uses machine learning to determine the authenticity of the listing, and make sure it is ethically received i.e. the organ will actually be transplanted, rather than trafficked, for instance."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"1) Clarity for Stacks Blockchain for organ transplant authentication\n\n2) Java and Kotlin for the Android app\n\n3) Firebase for the database backend/and user authentication into the app\n\n4) SciKit, Firebase and own Bayesian models for machine learning input"},{"heading":"Ethics","content":"We believe that access to healthcare is a basic human right, and that it is ethically wrong for us as a society to not act against the problem of the lack of medical care."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The all round social impact of the scale of the app, its features as well as who we can help in real time.
