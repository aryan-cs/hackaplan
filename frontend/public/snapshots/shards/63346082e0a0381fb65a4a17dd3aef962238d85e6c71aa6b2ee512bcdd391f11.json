The way we use the internet has changed dramatically over the last couple years, yet the way we search for images has not. Have you ever had a specific image in mind-- it's right there in front of you, but you just can't seem to describe it in a way that Google Images understands? With SketchIt, those days are no more."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"SketchIt allows you to draw an image and will return to you pictures that match your query. Looking for a picture of a pencil facing diagonally downwards? Easy. How about four fish stacked on top of each other? No problem. If you can imagine it, SketchIt will find it."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built the entire application almost from scratch. The main logic is written in Python and the only external library we use is OpenCV to generate the Canny Edge representation of images. The basic logic is as follows:\n\nGiven an input sketch S, we want to match it to one of the images stored in our database, D. We pre-process \"hit maps\" of each image based on their Canny Edge representation. The map essentially allows users a margin of error so that as long as their sketch falls within the map, it is still considered a match. We then look at our database of images and return the images with the most matches In order to further strengthen the matching we then do a reverse comparison from D -> S, in which we generate a hitmap based off the input sketch S and try to map the images from the previous step to S's hit map. Users can supply an optional \"tag\" query to aid their sketch. For instance, if the user drew a chicken, they can also supply the tag \"bird\" to narrow down the searching space\n\nOur database was built by scraping images from Bing using the Bing image search API. These images were then classified with tags using Microsoft Cognative Services' Vision API."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Since we implemented our algorithm basically from scratch, we ran into many many issues. One memorable problem we dubbed \"Night Sky\". Our algorithm was too sensitive to noise and as a result many images of the night sky would match everything because their hitmaps would cover the entire window.\n\nAnother hurdle we overcame was we were originally using sobel gradients to calculate the direction of each edge. This resulted in not so accurate directions. We then switched to convolution, which uses gradients of gaussians and drastically improved our results.\n\nLastly, scalibility was a large problem that we still have not completely overcome. Our database of images currently contains 8000 images. We would ideally have upwards of 2,000,000 images. Storing all those images and efficiently searching through them for each query in a reasonable amount of time was no easy task. In the end we used a reverse indexing in which we mapped every possible edge to a list of images that contained that edge. This provides efficient lookup times that were reasonable, but of course could always be improved."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"SketchIt is still in its infancy, but it is able to reliably match a number of images. In the very beginning, we were trying to match hearts and we literally had to trace over an image and even then we'd be lucky if the algorithm would images with hearts. Now, even Jon, our team's worst artist is able to freehand hearts and have SketchIt return the right images.\n\nWe are also very proud of the speed of our application. It may not seem like much, but you have to remember that with every sketch query, the application has to compare pixel by pixel each edge of the query sketch with every other pixel in each of the 8,000 images in our database. The current implementation runs in under 5 seconds on our laptops, which is a huge improvement over the 16 minutes it originally took to run one query."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Efficiency is so important. When dealing with a large amount of data, the smallest changes can result in huge increases or decreases in runtime. Scalibility was definitely our biggest roadblock and once we realized this we were able to change the way we approached the problem."},{"heading":"What's next for SketchIt","content":"Improvements to the algorithm will allow us to improve our accuracy even more. The biggest issue we have right now is that we simply do not have enough images to search through. A larger database of images will also improve results drastically."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bing cv2 java microsoft python vision"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Electric Boogaloo","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/electric-boogaloo-6vuwx0","tagline":"An electronic banjo that teaches you how to easily play","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/442/702/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall16.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Overall"},{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall16.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Design"},{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall16.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best DIY Project"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"golang","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/golang"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/CyrusRoshan/electric-boogaloo"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/bearcott/electric-boogaloo-frontend"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino golang react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"iCare","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/icare-vxgd4o","tagline":"Recognizes your change in emotions and provides feedback accordingly","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/441/317/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall16.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best First-Time-Hackathon Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"microsoft-bot-framework","url":null},{"name":"microsoft-cognitive-services","url":null},{"name":"opencv","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv"},{"name":"skype","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/skype"},{"name":"visual-studio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/kartikay18/ICare"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We spend a lot of our time sitting in front of the computer.

Sit back and watch your investments grow as we expertly manage a well diversified portfolio on your behalf."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Minvest is an application which uses algorithmic trading to manage clients' investment portfolios. The client simply transfers any amount of money from their bank account into the investment platform, and our algorithms take care of the rest. Each user is classified to a certain investment \"style\" or \"strategy\", depending on their own personal preferences, and based on these profiles, our algorithms pick out the best investments, and perform appropriate trades on the stock market when the timing is right. Our platform is a form of \"crowd investing\" in that users pool their money together in order to make investments that they normally would not be able to on their own. There are two current challenges with investments: either one cannot afford to make the minimum investments (usually minimum 100 shares, or a minimum dollar investment amount), or one cannot afford to diversify their portfolio in order to minimize their risks and maximize their opportunities. With Minvest, users now have access to investments previously out of their reach, and with trading and portfolios managed through algorithms, the management cost stays low, allowing us to offer no minimum investment required for our users. We believe that with this platform, more individuals will be able to benefit from the markets, as well as have a financial peace of mind that their money is expertly managed and will grow in the future."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our front-end client is an Android application, and our back end is created with Django. We used several APIs in our back-end to build our services algorithms. Using Capital One Nessie API we tightly integrate users' bank accounts, and allow them to easily transfer money from their bank into the platform, or withdraw from the platform and deposit into their bank accounts. In creating our algorithm that determines which securities to build our portfolio with, we used the Yahoo Finance API, which brings us key performance indicators of securities in which we analyze to select the best investments. The actual trading of these securities would be done through the Zipline API, which is built with Python.

Once we came to Princeton, there was an activity fair with hundreds of clubs and thousands of particpants, making gathering information about clubs difficult and inconvenient.

Much of Friday night and Saturday morning was spent learning the basics of the programming languages we needed for the project. However, our more experienced third team member was able to take on a mentorship role to provide the guidance that we needed. The final major challenge we faced was uploading it to the internet.

We all learned a great deal about how to program in a team and how to create small parts that fit together in the end into something amazing."},{"heading":"What's next for PrincetonClubs","content":"PrincetonClubs has a huge future ahead of it. We were only able to scratch the surface of the potential for this website. In the future we plan on adding individual pages for each group where they can display more detailed information and upcoming events. Users will also be able to submit questions or sign up for email lists directly on these pages. We will also add a login so that clubs can keep their pages up to date. Once we add a login, we will be able to explore other possibilities such as providing a platform for users to submit their applications to clubs and create personal calendars with clubs events they are interested in. Eventually we plan to develop our idea into a mobile app."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bootstrap css3 html5 javascript jquery ptonoffun"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"oliviajohnsto.github.io github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:50:20.401127Z"}}
