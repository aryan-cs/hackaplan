Time management was an issue that we faced, and that we will address for the future. Optimal APIs With a variety of different APIs available online, we spent a long time researching and deciding on the optimal API for our purposes. Thankfully in the end, we were able to decide on IBM Watson's text-to-speech API that worked perfectly for us.

The traditional metaphors of centralized servers and local storage will inevitably become obsolete in an age of ever growing data, and an ever growing threat to the data. IPD, or InterPlanetary Desktops, is a decentralized, blockchain based method of storing and accessing secure and reliable virtual machines. IPD set out to solve the problems of centralized and vulnerable computing, while making use of new technologies that can better improve convenience, and security."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"IPD uses IPFS (InterPlanetary File System), a blockchain based technology, allowing for a secure, reliable, and a decentralized method of storing user data and operating system. A user's standard operating system (such as Ubuntu or Windows), is replaced with the IPD OS. IPD OS can load Virtual Machines from IPFS on the fly, meaning your data is never stored locally and vulnerably, but stored on the IPFS Blockchain.\n\nEffectively, you can access your personal virtual desktop from anywhere in the world, from any computer running the IPD Operating System."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The centerpiece of IPD is IPFS, a blockchain based, peer to peer, decentralized storage system. A user's virtual machine is seamlessly uploaded and synced on IPFS, and loaded from any computer running the IPD Operating System.\n\nThe IPD OS is derived from Ubuntu Linux, running a custom user interface written in Electron. This UI is run independently on the computer, using OpenBox and X11. The UI allows the user to login and access their virtual machine. The VM's themselves are run using QEMU/KVM, a fast and consistent virtualization platform. This means that a user's virtual desktop will run the same, regardless of the computer they are accessing it from.\n\nUser's register their accounts from a Registry. A registry is a standalone node.js server that keeps track of registered users, and their virtual desktops (represented as IPFS hashs). There doesn't have to be any single registry, as users can choose a hosted solution, or run their own. The important data (this is, the VM image) is stored on IPFS.\n\nThe registry is an important feature of IPD. A file uploaded to IPFS is referenced using a unique hash. If changes are made to a file, a new hash is generated. The registry keeps track of these hashs and let's the IPD OS load the correct one.\n\nThe IPD reference registry is run on Azure. The Azure VM has a couple of roles, including running the registry, running the IPFS Daemon (ensuring fast delivery of VM images), and distributing \"base\" OS images (from which user images are derived from).\n\nThat is: user VMs are stored (decentralized) on IPFS. From any computer running the IPD Operating System (based on Linux), from any place in the world, a user can run and access their virtual desktop by logging into a IPD Registry. The virtual desktop is fetched from IPFS and is run on QEMU/KVM. After they log out, the data is synced back with IPFS, ready to be accessed once again."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"A big issue that we ran into was... NodeJS. Node is a great language, especially early on for rapid development of our idea, but later on the intricacies of the language start to become a real pain. Compared to other languages, JavaScript doesn't play well with different types. This is usually okay, even makes things easy, but becomes messy with larger applications. NodeJS/JavaScript errors are not very specific or helpful, meaning that debugging becomes a laborious task. The architecture of Electron is interesting aswell. There are 2 contexts, a \"server\" and \"render\", effectively meaning there is an isolated backend to the frontend. Running code and switching contexts can become tedious.\n\nBesides code, we only ran into a few issues. We spent some time on working on IPD OS. In the end we use the \"nodm\" display manager to launch OpenBox, which starts our UI frontend. Another small issue we ran into was with registering our Azure VM. The Azure panel is quite slow at times, and we ran into one issue where a new virtual network wasn't being created with the new VM, causing the setup to hang."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"For us, the fact that we were able to pull this off in the timeframe given is, quite frankly, amazing. There was a lot to deal with, and an equal amount of debugging, but we have a (more or less) prototype that has everything we envisioned. Another big accomplishment was in the efficiency in implementation. Rather than saving the full VM image to the blockchain, which would be slow (an image for Windows 10 is about 7GB), we use QEMU's Copy on Write feature. This means that images that are saved to the blockchain are simply the difference from the base image (that is, the user's custom data)."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned quite a broad range of topics. For one, we learned quite a bit about blockchains and IPFS. We also got much more familiar with NodeJS and Electron (and it's many quirks). Finally, we learned more about the architecture of a Linux-based OS, such as running a custom application on X11 on boot."},{"heading":"What's next for InterPlanetary Desktop","content":"We believe IPD has a bright future ahead of it. For one, we will definitely refactor parts of the code that were written subpar (due to the time limitations). There are lots of little enhancements and tweaks we would do to improve the overall user experience. For example, a progress bar when fetching the users image from the blockchain."},{"heading":"How to install IPD OS Manually","content":"Use the utility nodm to start IPD on boot from any Linux distribution."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"blockchain electron ipfs kvm linux node.js qemu"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Audite","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/hjkhhj","tagline":"An device that assists those with a hearing impairment with day to day life.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/684/598/datas/medium.jpeg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2018","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2018 Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"raspberry-pi","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/raspberry-pi"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We were inspired by this idea after not being able to hear one of our group members in a noisy place and thought about how people with hearing issues would experience this type of thing every day."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The application shows you the direction of the voice that's talking to you and shows the spoken words as text on the screen."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"We have a three-microphone pattern that sits on top of a hat and sends the angle of where the voice was coming from to your phone, which shows direction.

This means that parts of the object outside of the near clip plane of the camera will not get its depth written to the buffer. All the objects in the world are rendered with a solid colour, with front-face culled.

The device polls a central authentication server (Azure) for commands (in particular, authentication or enrollment), and proceeds to receive and validate input from the user. The results of these commands are pushed back to the authentication server and stored in a PostgreSQL database, which is queried for login operations. A Tornado webservice is used for handling the receiving end of device authentication packets, as well as servicing operations like login and enrollment.\n\nUser-sensitive data (fingerprints) never leave the device, and all communication with the central server is over strict SSL. We also protect against packet replay attacks by implementing time-sensitive tokens in all communications based on a shared secret between devices and the authentication server.\n\nWe have an external website running on a Flask backend as the main configuration site.\n\nWe've also built out a Chrome extension which can auto-fill username and password data on sites you use, locked behind our 3-factor authentication. It's similar to e.g. LastPass, but with some added security for unlocking -- but it's also more convenient to tap than to enter a password."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"There were some browser issues when developing the JavaScript for the front end of our website."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are extremely proud of finishing a working product.

A demo of the app can be seen here\n\nWalabot RF 3D Scanner\n\nThe Walabot scanner is interfaced with via the Python SDK. Numerous displays have been developed for this project: The ability to view a live 3D graph of the scanner arena, a visualization of the energy (a normalized sum of all pixels) of the scanner, and a 2D projection of the original 3D data.\n\nTwo means of facial recognition were implemented. First, training data of faces and not faces were recorded from the 2D projection, and a clustering algorithm was trained to recognize faces. This was met with limited success, so a statistical approach was implemented instead. The sensor records an energy profile of items it should reject, such as an empty background. The energy samples (1000 in the calibration data) are approximately normally distributed. To recognize a face, energy is sampled numerous times, which is again normal. A t-statistic is then used to compute the statistical likelihood that the measured sample is different from the calibration data. If that is the case, we have recognized a face, as opposed to, for example, a piece of paper with an image which is transparent to the RF signals or a phone which has the wrong footprint.. The camera and facial recognition algorithm then authenticate the face."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Being able to integrate so many moving pieces in a short amount of time, and not having to \"hard\" code anything!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"alexa arduino avs cansofcom ibm-watson opencv raspberry-pi rbc react-native"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Re:Music","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/re-music","tagline":"Easy online sheet music reviewing","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/681/573/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2018","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Google Firebase API Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"bootstrap","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap"},{"name":"css3","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"html5","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5"},{"name":"jquery","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/jquery"}],"external_links":[{"label":"remusic-cf7bd.firebaseapp.com","url":"https://remusic-cf7bd.firebaseapp.com/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/xinxinw1/remusic"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"A lot of people like to write music, and a lot of those people like to get their sheet music reviewed by their peers, including two of our three team members.

The problem was designed specifically such that simple machine learning methods would not work. We thought the problem was interesting and wanted to see what we could do to solve it.\n\nThe problem involved a dataset with approximately 480 000 rows. Each row represented an alien with good or bad intentions. We had to figure out which aliens were good and which were evil.\n\nA testing set and a challenge set of similar length were provided. For each of the rows, there were 77 columns of data. Each column contains numbers. There was no information provided to detect what each column represented. The testing set had an additional column that identified each row as good or evil."},{"heading":"Data Exploration","content":"We began by exploring the data, looking for any patterns.\n\nWhile projecting the data into 2-D, we found it initially appeared to be completely dense. However, after we imposed a loose constraint on each axis, we noticed the data was actually quite sparse and only appeared dense due to projecting a very high dimensional space into two dimensions.\n\nAfter analyzing just the evil data points we found that the points appeared to be clustered inside scattered hyper-cubes. This was significant because the good data points did not have this relationship. This was the key to our approach."},{"heading":"Training","content":"A reasonable direction to take with the model is to measure the number of nearby points for each point then classify based on that. Due to the size of the dataset, this is computationally infeasible by brute force.\n\nTo simplify this process, we employ k-means clustering. This creates partitions of the data which tries to group together dense regions of the space. We also wanted each centroid to roughly represent each cluster, so we chose 300 mean points (which is roughly the number of means that we have found via experimentation).\n\nNow we have many clusters that are much smaller than the total dataset, so doing computations in these clusters is significantly easier. Within these clusters, if a point is near another point nearby, we consider it to be a potential bad point, but if the converse occurs it is almost definitely a good point. This drastically reduces the number of points that need to be considered as bad points.\n\nTo do a strict filtering for the bad points, we realize that the neighbours for a point are bad (bad points have many bad neighbours while good points have very few neighbours). This means that when we want to look for the nearby neighbours of a point, it suffices to only look at the potential bad points that were determined from before. Since this set is much smaller than the whole dataset, it is now computationally feasible and we simply brute force on the whole dataset by comparing only to these potential bad points. Anything that is found to have many nearby points (greater than 4) is classified as a bad point, otherwise it's classified as good."},{"heading":"Challenges","content":"There were a number of challenges that made this project difficult:\n\nThe sheer size of the dataset meant that many solutions simply took too long to run The evil data clusters within the training set were not found within the challenge set. This means that we could not use the training set (and the labels in the training set) to identify the regions to classify the challenge set. We had to therefore treat the problem as an unsupervised learning problem and develop a solution that did not depend on the labels in the training set It was difficult to initially analyze the data due to the number of data points and the complexity of 77-dimensional space. We had to figure out how to see through the noise in the data before we could begin analysis"},{"heading":"Results","content":"We were able to achieve 99.98% accuracy on the challenge set.

Mental health is an extremely important part in attaining an excellent quality of life. Rates of depression have risen by more than 18% since 2005, and a lack of a strong support system for individuals with mental illness, means many do not get the treatment they need to live healthy, productive lives. We decided to tackle this issue by creating a website that will alert doctors of their patients mental condition in advance, so they are able to give them the support they need to recover."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our hack is presented in the form of a website, to connect a doctor and their patient. Our website scans information from the clients social media accounts (i.e facebook), searching for certain keywords, explicit objects in photographs, filters, and analyzes the overall tone of their page. After all this information is extracted, key information or outliers, is displayed on the website accessible to the doctor. This development greatly speeds up the process of the doctor/therapist asking initial questions to feel out the patient. Now, the doctor is able to get a feel for the patient and have information if a patient is at risk for depression or mental illness, therefore he/she is more prepared to deal with this sensitive case. All in all, our website aims to bridge the gap between doctors and their patients, in order to provide patients with the care that they need as soon as possible."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Starting with the backend, we used python and several of it’s machine learning frameworks that allowed us to predict possible dangerous topics related to each post. The posts were extracted using a Facebook API (graph explorer) and analysed using several functions made by us. By using other python frameworks we were able to get the prominent colours and saturation of pictures posted by the patient. This information can then be processed by estimating if a patient’s pictures indicates them struggling through a mental illness such as depression. The frameworks used include: Colorgram for colours, Indicoio for text and machine learning, and Clarifai for object detection. For example we used Clarifai’s API to detect objects that are considered to be unsafe or unnatural such as knives, guns and other weapons. By highlighting these objects, it is to be noted that they may be suffering from suicidal thoughts, severe anxiety and violent or addictive behaviour. Finally, the doctor can help the patient according to their professional judgement and the information given by the website."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The challenges our group encountered were mainly in extracting the data from Facebook and finding a way to gather the information all in one place. We were using different languages for different aspects of our data, therefore it made it difficult to transfer files and assemble the information in one place. Finding the perfect API to execute our ideas proved to be difficult, as each API did things slightly different. Our group also had member with little or no hackathon experience, so it was a new learning experience for our team. This meant the initial preparation and programming proved a bit more challenging than we imagined. Overall, we managed to persevere and overcome all our challenges because we worked effectively together as a team, communicating and dividing the workload."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are really proud that our group was able to come together and work so well together to make such a beneficial app. It was a huge accomplishment that we were able to plan and execute an idea we were all passionate about.

Overall, we are very grateful to attend such a huge and excellent hackathon and create something that we can be proud of."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"By attending Hack the North we were able to learn a lot more about the world of programming, business, and technology. We especially enjoyed talking to all the sponsors, as we believe they helped expand our knowledge on different job industries and different job expectations. Another highlight was interacting with other eager hackers at the event. We were able to learn a lot more about the school and social life at Waterloo by talking to UW students. We made it our goal to socialize and talk to as many people as we could to really absorb as much information as we could at Hack the North. At the hackathon, we learned a great deal about the business and technology industries, programs and applying to university, and also improved my programming skills, learning from my teammates and other hackers competing."},{"heading":"What's next for HealthApp","content":"The next step for Healthy Bridge is to market our website to a larger demographic, specifically targeting it towards the municipal healthcare system. Our website is universal in its application, therefore many different organizations can take advantage of our service. We would also have to further develop our business plan to realistically reach out to the municipal, provincial, and national government to see our website in full effect. There is also room for improvement regarding our website and its functionality. We will continue to add new features and improve the existing mechanics. Though the system has its imperfections, t could be beneficial for bridging the gap between patients and doctors which can intern save many lives. Overall, Hack the North was just the start of our innovation to help social justice.

The drone we used was the personal property of one of our group members, however it was disassembled when it first arrived at Hack the North. Putting together a drone without an instruction manual proved to be extraordinarily difficult.

Overall, we’re proud of the fact that FireWatch encompasses every resource an individual would need when dealing with forest fires while providing a user-friendly interface."},{"heading":"What We Learned","content":"Our biggest take-away from FireWatch is learning how to take advantage of multiple platforms/tools to provide the best user functionality for a singular purpose. Put simply, we realized that by combining relevant APIs, data, and algorithms under a common UI, it is possible to provide almost any functionality."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css emailjs google-places here-maps-api html javscript nasa-modis news-api"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"54.174.75.231 github.com"}]},{"project_title":"AgroBot","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/argobot","tagline":"A smart agriculture robot","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/682/594/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2018","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best use of Google Cloud Platform"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"arduino","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/arduino"},{"name":"c++","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--3"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"kotlin","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"ros","url":null},{"name":"victory","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/nlieb/agrobot"},{"label":"agribot-2019.firebaseapp.com","url":"https://agribot-2019.firebaseapp.com/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Our goal is to reduce the usage of herbicides and foster a fair playing field for non-GMO and organic farmers."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"AgroBot autonomously detects weeds and removes them using a mechanical robotic system. This reduces the need for herbicides and reducing the human cost in maintaining crops. AgroBot also features a web dashboard that allows for real time monitoring of AgroBot and the fields health."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"AgroBot uses the Nvida Jetson TX2 running the Robot Operating System (ROS). Using the TX2's on board camera and DarkNet neural network platform using YOLO, AgroBot is able to visually detect weeds. Then using AgroBots set of motors and linear actuator, the weed is then forced from the ground. AgroBot also uses a mobile phone attached to the robot for enhanced geolocation reporting.\n\nThe online dashboard and systems for AgroBot were built using React and Firebase. The online dashboard provides a real time live stream of weed detection, location, real time graphs on performance and the ability to control AgroBot. The online dashboard can rearranged, re-sized and reformatted by dragging and dropping panes. The online dashboard is also protected using Firebases authentication systems."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The interfacing between AgroBot mechanical systems and software systems were a very complex challenge. We also blew a PWM board with 4 hours left and had to build an alternative board using an Arduino UNO."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"All the hardware and software integrations required to get AgroBot to work within the time span of Hack the North."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned lots about manufacturing with limited tools within a tight timeline. We also gained lots of experience with DarkNet and with training ML models and interfacing with them on the TX2."},{"heading":"What's next for ArgoBot","content":"ArgoBot would need to be beefed up mechanically in order to better withstand the challenges of normal farming."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android arduino c++ firebase google-cloud javascript kotlin python react ros victory"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com agribot-2019.firebaseapp.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:52:40.980040Z"}}
