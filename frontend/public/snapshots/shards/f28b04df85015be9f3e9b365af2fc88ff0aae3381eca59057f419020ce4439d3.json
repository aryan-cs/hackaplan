Every trip, we’d end up with a long receipt filled with shared and individual items, and the process of calculating who owed what became a repetitive hassle. We’d manually go through the receipt, divide the costs, and send payment requests—sometimes leading to confusion, miscalculations, or delays in getting reimbursed.\n\nI wanted to create a smoother, more efficient solution. Instead of doing the math manually or relying on external apps that required everyone to enter their payment details and wait for others to send money, I envisioned an app that could automate the process. By simply taking a photo of the receipt, generating a shareable QR code, and allowing everyone to select their own items, the app could instantly calculate each person’s share and handle the transaction within the platform.\n\nThis project eliminates the tedious back-and-forth, making bill-splitting as simple as snapping a picture and letting technology do the rest."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"This project streamlines the process of splitting receipts by leveraging AI-powered text recognition and real-time collaboration. Users can take a photo of a receipt, and the app utilizes Gemini for character recognition to extract item details automatically. A QR code is then generated, allowing friends to quickly access the shared receipt without needing to manually enter information.\n\nOnce inside the app, users can view a real-time interactive list and select the items they purchased. The app supports multi-person selection for a single item, making it easy to fairly divide shared expenses like pizzas or bulk purchases. Past transaction history is also stored, enabling users to review previous receipts and payments for better tracking. Finally, instead of relying on external payment apps, the platform includes built-in in-app payments, allowing users to instantly settle their share of the bill, eliminating the need for manual money transfers and follow-ups.\n\nBy combining AI, real-time collaboration, and seamless payments, this project makes receipt-splitting effortless and efficient."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"For the frontend, we used Next.js with React and TypeScript to create a dynamic and scalable user interface. Styling was handled with Tailwind CSS and shadcn, ensuring a clean and modern design. To manage global state efficiently, we utilized Jotai, allowing seamless real-time interactions. Additionally, Sonner was implemented for intuitive toast notifications, enhancing the user experience.\n\nOn the backend, we built a Flask API with Python, serving as the core for processing requests and integrating machine learning. We used Gemini for AI-powered receipt text recognition, allowing automatic extraction of item details from images.\n\nFor data storage and authentication, we integrated Firebase Firestore and Firebase Authentication, ensuring secure user management and fast access to receipt data. API communication between the frontend and backend was protected using Firebase security rules.\n\nWe used pnpm as our package manager for efficient dependency management, ensuring a smooth development workflow. By combining AI-powered text recognition, real-time state management, and secure API communication, we built an intuitive and seamless bill-splitting solution."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We faced a range of obstacles that really pushed our limits. Designing a UI that offers precise, customizable options without overwhelming users was tougher than expected. We debated how detailed the splitting process should be—whether to let users pick individual items or group them—while still keeping the experience clean and intuitive. Integrating all these options into a smooth, flowing interface required multiple iterations and user tests.\n\nOn the technical side, connecting the frontend to the backend was a constant battle. We ran into various HTTP errors that slowed us down, including a notorious 405 error that haunted us for three straight hours. These issues forced us to rethink our API interactions and work hard to streamline the communication between systems. In the end, overcoming these challenges not only refined our code but also improved the overall user experience."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Despite the hurdles, we're proud to have delivered a robust product in a short span of time. EasySplit now seamlessly converts a scanned receipt into a detailed list of items and quantities, making it incredibly straightforward for users to select exactly what they owe. We implemented intuitive progress bars that clearly show each user's share, which has significantly enhanced the ease of use.\n\nAdditionally, the quick generation of QR codes enables a smooth onboarding process for groups, ensuring that everyone can join in and settle their part of the bill effortlessly. Our ability to merge complex backend processes with a clean, user-friendly interface is a testament to our team's dedication and resilience."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Many of our group members were new to using such a varied tech stack so we learnt to quickly adapt to new paradigms and integrate them into the project.

We will be able to map out our terrain using the ultrasonic sensor and determine the closeness of certain objects. We will use the camera to take a picture of the environment that was scanned and display the depth graphically to a user. This will also give the vehicle data such as close-by obstacles. Then, the vehicle will be able to navigate itself towards open areas. If the vehicle gets close to a steep pathway (for example, a cliff), it will be able to detect it using the ultrasonic sensor, and then position itself away from the danger zone. We will also be using the vehicle's camera to track down a distinct object. The vehicle will then try to find and reach that object."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We first assembled the robot using the instructions given to us by John Deere. We then needed to replace the camera mount with an ultrasonic sensor mount. This means that the ultrasonic sensor is connected to the servos. Additionally, we had to modify the ultrasonic sensor to reduce its range of vision to give us more precise readings. Next we used the ultrasonic sensor to scan and develop a 3D map of it surroundings. We also developed code to first take a picture of the environment. Then, using the information from the ultrasonic sensor, we are able to map out the closeness of objects by dividing up the image into sections. Then we developed the code to determine whether the vehicle is approaching an obstacle or a steep point, and then maneuver away from the trouble area. This is all done using the ultrasonic sensor. Lastly we worked on the camera vision code to detect and follow a target object (in this case a green ball)"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had trouble trying to SSH into the Raspberry Pi due to the connection dropping and issues connecting to the internet. One of our cameras had weird artifacts on the lens that we couldn't remove. So, we ended up getting a new camera. Then the new camera did not have the necessary width for mapping out the environment. So we ended up switching back to our old camera since it had the desired depth. We had issues trying to use the ultrasonic sensor. There were some faulty readings (i.e. objects were being reported as far when in reality they were close by). One of the fixes was to change our environment to a larger room, as a small enclosed space reflects the ultrasonic waves more easily and interferes with the readings. Similarly, we had problems trying to use the ultrasonic sensor to detect cliff, so we further modified our custom mounts to address this issue"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We 3D printed a part that allowed us to direct the ultrasonic waves from the sensor. This way, the ultrasonic sensor has a more narrow and precise range. We also created a custom 3D printed mount for the ultrasonic sensor. Positioning it so that it was able to face the ground plane, we could better determine which parts of the environment were drivable. The autonomous decision making using the 3D mapping data from the ultrasonic sensor is especially interesting. The robot uses this data to make a decision on the most open path to take."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We got to learn a lot about Raspberry Pi, Autonomous Vehicle programming, OpenCV, and being able to creatively modify our project to solve our problems."},{"heading":"What's next for Autonomous Navigation - John Deere Track","content":"We're looking to better design our robot for even better depth readings.

The options are between The North Dakota Row Crop Farm, The Illinois Row Crop Farm, or anywhere else. Depending on the location, FarmSmart will find the best possible tools to use at this area by factoring in your budget, operational costs, total area, and the environmental factors around you. We will then output a full cost analysis in the form of graphs and charts. Additionally, we have implemented pesticide detection features where farmers can upload images of their wilting crops to our model and we identify potential causes and solutions."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"First, we utilized a web-soil API in which we were able to extract information on farmlands across the nation. Using data from sources like USDA’s Web Soil Survey and satellite imagery, we analyzed the important soil properties such as moisture levels, compaction, erosion risk, and nutrient content. This data was fed into our backend (Python, PostgreSQL, and OpenCV), where we processed it alongside weather data and equipment availability. The OpenAI API then used this data to generate custom tillage recommendations that optimize cost, efficiency, and soil health. We then displayed our results in the frontend through (React, Next.js, Typescript, Tailwind, and Shadcn) in the form of text and bar/graph charts."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our most significant challenge was tailoring FarmSmart towards specific farms that the user inputted.
