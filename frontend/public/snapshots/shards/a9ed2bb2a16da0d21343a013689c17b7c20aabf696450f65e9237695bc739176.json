The need to adjust to life without vision, often after decades of relying on it for daily life, presents a unique challenge to individuals facing genetic disease or ocular injury, one which our teammate saw firsthand in his family, and inspired our group to work on a modular, affordable solution. Current technologies which provide similar proximity awareness often cost many thousands of dollars, and require a niche replacement in the user's environment; (shoes with active proximity sensing similar to our system often cost $3-4k for a single pair of shoes). Instead, our group has worked to create a versatile module which can be attached to any shoe, walker, or wheelchair, to provide situational awareness to the thousands of people adjusting to their loss of vision."},{"heading":"What it does (Higher quality demo on google drive link!: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o2mxJXDgxnnhsT8eL4pCnbk_yFVVWiNM/view?usp=share_link )","content":"The module is constantly pinging its surroundings through a combination of IR and ultrasonic sensors. These are readily visible on the prototype, with the ultrasound device looking forward, and the IR sensor looking to the outward flank. These readings are referenced, alongside measurements from an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), to tell when the user is nearing an obstacle. The combination of sensors allows detection of a wide gamut of materials, including those of room walls, furniture, and people. The device is powered by a 7.4v LiPo cell, which displays a charging port on the front of the module. The device has a three hour battery life, but with more compact PCB-based electronics, it could easily be doubled. While the primary use case is envisioned to be clipped onto the top surface of a shoe, the device, roughly the size of a wallet, can be attached to a wide range of mobility devices.\n\nThe internal logic uses IMU data to determine when the shoe is on the bottom of a step 'cycle', and touching the ground. The Arduino Nano MCU polls the IMU's gyroscope to check that the shoe's angular speed is close to zero, and that the module is not accelerating significantly. After the MCU has established that the shoe is on the ground, it will then compare ultrasonic and IR proximity sensor readings to see if an obstacle is within a configurable range (in our case, 75cm front, 10cm side).\n\nIf the shoe detects an obstacle, it will activate a pager motor which vibrates the wearer's shoe (or other device). The pager motor will continue vibrating until the wearer takes a step which encounters no obstacles, thus acting as a toggle flip-flop.\n\nAn RGB LED is added for our debugging of the prototype: RED - Shoe is moving - In the middle of a step GREEN - Shoe is at bottom of step and sees an obstacle BLUE - Shoe is at bottom of step and sees no obstacles\n\nWhile our group's concept is to package these electronics into a sleek, clip-on plastic case, for now the electronics have simply been folded into a wearable form factor for demonstration."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our group used an Arduino Nano, batteries, voltage regulators, and proximity sensors from the venue, and supplied our own IMU, kapton tape, and zip ties. (yay zip ties!)\n\nI2C code for basic communication and calibration was taken from a user's guide of the IMU sensor. Code used for logic, sensor polling, and all other functions of the shoe was custom. All electronics were custom.\n\nTesting was done on the circuits by first assembling the Arduino Microcontroller Unit (MCU) and sensors on a breadboard, powered by laptop. We used this setup to test our code and fine tune our sensors, so that the module would behave how we wanted. We tested and wrote the code for the ultrasonic sensor, the IR sensor, and the gyro separately, before integrating as a system.\n\nNext, we assembled a second breadboard with LiPo cells and a 5v regulator. The two 3.7v cells are wired in series to produce a single 7.4v 2S battery, which is then regulated back down to 5v by an LM7805 regulator chip. One by one, we switched all the MCU/sensor components off of laptop power, and onto our power supply unit. Unfortunately, this took a few tries, and resulted in a lot of debugging.\n\n. After a circuit was finalized, we moved all of the breadboard circuitry to harnessing only, then folded the harnessing and PCB components into a wearable shape for the user."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The largest challenge we ran into was designing the power supply circuitry, as the combined load of the sensor DAQ package exceeds amp limits on the MCU. This took a few tries (and smoked components) to get right. The rest of the build went fairly smoothly, with the other main pain points being the calibration and stabilization of the IMU readings (this simply necessitated more trials) and the complex folding of the harnessing, which took many hours to arrange into its final shape."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud to find a good solution to balance the sensibility of the sensors. We're also proud of integrating all the parts together, supplying them with appropriate power, and assembling the final product as small as possible all in one day."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Power was the largest challenge, both in terms of the electrical engineering, and the product design- ensuring that enough power can be supplied for long enough, while not compromising on the wearability of the product, as it is designed to be a versatile solution for many different shoes. Currently the design has a 3 hour battery life, and is easily rechargeable through a pair of front ports. The challenges with the power system really taught us firsthand how picking the right power source for a product can determine its usability. We were also forced to consider hard questions about our product, such as if there was really a need for such a solution, and what kind of form factor would be needed for a real impact to be made. Likely the biggest thing we learned from our hackathon project was the importance of the end user, and of the impact that engineering decisions have on the daily life of people who use your solution. For example, one of our primary goals was making our solution modular and affordable. Solutions in this space already exist, but their high price and uni-functional design mean that they are unable to have the impact they could. Our modular design hopes to allow for greater flexibility, acting as a more general tool for situational awareness."},{"heading":"What's next for Smart Shoe Module","content":"Our original idea was to use a combination of miniaturized LiDAR and ultrasound, so our next steps would likely involve the integration of these higher quality sensors, as well as a switch to custom PCBs, allowing for a much more compact sensing package, which could better fit into the sleek, usable clip on design our group envisions.\n\nAdditional features might include the use of different vibration modes to signal directional obstacles and paths, and indeed expanding our group's concept of modular assistive devices to other solution types.\n\nWe would also look forward to making a more professional demo video Current example clip of the prototype module taking measurements:( https://youtube.com/shorts/ECUF5daD5pU?feature=share )"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino imu irsensor mpu soldering ultrasound"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"drive.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"Aqua Shot","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/aquashot","tagline":"Spray your friends, and make NFT's that we'll send!

We were drawn to the use of water as a potential alternative to a traditional alarm.\n\nThinking beyond an alarm, we found an opportunity to use robots to augment livestreams and strengthen the bond between content creators and consumers. As users donate to control the robot and interact with a creator, they receive NFTs of moments that can be cherished far into the future.\n\nWe came to see a use case in the realm of virtual human interactions. Particularly, we focused on how to foster a more meaningful connection between streamers and their audience, which platforms such as Twitch are constantly trying to find innovations in.

They're meant to increase vault security by splitting up a digital signature across N parties, requiring at least T of them to sign off before any action (e.g. \"liquidate funds\" or \"pay contractor\") is taken. Though adversaries now need to compromise at least T parties to exploit, vanilla schemes come with a significant drawback. Signature shares are stagnant, so adversaries can target the T parties over the course of months, eventually resulting in a hack regardless of the threshold parameter.\n\nIt's a common occurrence. The Ronin Bridge was secured by a 5-of-7 multisig. Adversaries compromised keys one at a time to drain the contract of $650M. The Harmony Bridge was secured by a 2-of-5 multisig. Again, adversaries compromised two keys separately for a $100M exploit."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Proactive refresh is a promising solution to these vulnerabilities. It's a way to renew signature shares every 30 seconds. Think of it as Google Authenticator for threshold signatures. Adversaries would then need to compromise all T keys (eg. all 5 keys for Ronin) within the span of 30 seconds- a much harder task.\n\nA simple concept, but building it to be cryptographically secure is fairly challenging. So much so that a valid construction was only recently proposed in a 2022 theory paper coming out of the Boneh laboratory. It satisfied many challenging requirements, namely: 1) having no central point of failure, 2) preserving the original vault, and 3) tracing back to signers. The scheme does so while providing security guarantees of unforgeability and accountability.\n\nWe built out this primitive from scratch (first team to do so, to our knowledge). To demonstrate how powerful it is, we deployed a cross-chain vault on ZetaChain that's secured by a 5-of-7 threshold signature. Any adversary that wishes to drain the vault must compromise 5 signature shares in the span of 30 seconds. We think this would be unlikely."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The scheme is instantiated by sampling N secret keys from the base field of the BLS12-381 curve. One key is handed to each party via a secure communication channel. T parties can then come together, with each individually signing the message to create T signatures. We use lagrange interpolation to find the lowest degree polynomial that \"fits\" to these signatures, with f(0) on the polynomial set as the collective signature. Notice that each set of T signers has a unique collective signature, allowing us trace back to who signed. Accountability! A big deal when dealing with mission-critical requests.\n\nTo verify these signatures, we can again fit the lowest degree polynomial over the public keys for these parties. Due to the handy linearity property of BLS signatures (tracing back to the linearity of pairings over elliptic curves), this collective public key verifies the signature as expected.\n\nThat's how we implement accountable threshold BLS signatures. Now for proactive refresh. Every 30 seconds, all N parties are required to sample a new T-1 degree polynomial that passes through the origin. Every party then needs to add the corresponding point from all N polynomials to their local secret key. This completely changes what their secret key is. But, since all the new polynomials pass through the origin, all collective signatures at f(0) are still the same (read: vault kept intact). What's more, each party contributed equally to the update process, so there's no single point of failure.\n\nA key that is compromised in one update round by an adversary is now useless in the following update round since the joint polynomial is completely different. Mission accomplished.\n\nTo demonstrate how powerful this primitive is, we deployed an asset vault on ZetaChain based on a custom fork of Gnosis Safe . We modified the isValidSignature function and the signature verification logic in the execTransaction method of the Safe to instead rely on an on-chain ZK proof of a valid BLS signature generated using this signature scheme. Beyond modifying the signature scheme, we also took advantage of ZetaChain's zEVM features: the vault can accept messages from any blockchain supported by ZetaChain. To demonstrate this capability, we wrote a GnosisSafeZetaChainClient contract which we deployed to Goerli. A call to execTransaction on this Goerli contract which contains a valid signature parameter will trigger a transaction on the main ZetaChain vault using ZetaChain's cross-chain messaging. This simplifies multisig management as now there is a single source of truth for managing the assets and signature verification of the vault — the Safe instance on ZetaChain."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Implementing the scheme was pretty difficult. It's elegant and doable to understand from a high level, but the nitty gritty lost us a good bit of sleep:\n\n1) Existing libraries with components we needed had group elements that didn't play well together, so we had to implement the primitive from scratch. Our rust implementation included BLS signatures (elliptic curve pairings and group operations on BLS12-381), accountability (variant of Shamir's secret sharing scheme with lagrange interpolation), and proactive refresh (sampling these strategic polynomials).\n\n2) Needed zkSNARKs. ZetaChain (& EVM) doesn't have the BLS precompile, so verifying the signature on-chain would've costed an ungodly amount of gas. We remedied this with a SNARK. Instead of checking the BLS signature on chain, we check it in a circuit and verify just the proof on chain. This was a hefty engineering lift since the computational model in a circuit is fairly different from what we dealt with in rust. It was especially difficult because we needed to do complex field arithmetic (pairings) that doesn't play well with the field that bn128 (the main zkSNARK elliptic curve) provides. We built this on the circom/snarkjs stack and used groth16 as our proving system. NOTE: The correct circuit is still compiling here, so the vault we have live right now can be spoofed by a well-informed adversary.\n\n3) The default Gnosis Safe deployment process recommended by the Gnosis Safe team relies on presigned transactions generated from a key that only the Gnosis Safe team controls. These presigned transactions only work for deployment on certain whitelisted chains. Unfortunately, ZetaChain was not on the whitelist, so we had to make significant modifications to the Safe's constructor and deployment scripts in order to get a working Safe instance on ZetaChain. After getting the Safe working on ZetaChain, we spent extensive time digging into Solidity abi-coding and memory vs. calldata nuances to make sure data was passed in the correct encoding and format from Goerli to ZetaChain (e.g. we needed to calculate the correct offset to slice a calldata byte array by to get calldata bytes instead of memory bytes). We also ran into some contract size ceilings that we ended up mitigating by deleting legacy signature verification code used by the default Gnosis Safe verification algorithm that wasn't necessary under the new BLS signature scheme."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"1) Rust crate that's the first working example of proactive refresh for accountable threshold signatures.\n\n2) Cross-chain vault on ZetaChain that we're willing to put money on (maybe?).\n\n3) ZK proofs that solidified the end-to-end implementation from primitive to dapp."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Though our team had some cryptography / ZK background going into this, this was still massively difficult.

The majority of Americans can’t get a cup of coffee or go to the grocery store without a car.\n\nWhat would America look like with cleaner air, walkable cities, green spaces, and effective routing from place to place that builds on infrastructure for active transport and micro mobility? This is the question we answer, and show, to urban planners, at an extremely granular street level.\n\nCompared to most of Europe and Asia (where there are public transportation options, human-scale streets, and dense neighborhoods) the United States is light-years away ... but urban planners don’t have the tools right now to easily assess a specific area’s walkability.\n\nHere's why this is an urgent problem: Current tools for urban planners don’t provide location-specific information —they only provide arbitrary, high-level data overviews over a 50-mile or so radius about population density. Even though consumers see new tools, like Google Maps’ area busyness bars, it is only bits and pieces of all the data an urban planner needs, like data on bike paths, bus stops, and the relationships between traffic and pedestrians.\n\nAs a result, there’s very few actionable improvements that urban planners can make. Moreover, because cities are physical spaces, planners cannot easily visualize what an improvement (e.g. adding a bike/bus lane, parks, open spaces) would look like in the existing context of that specific road. Many urban planners don’t have the resources or capability to fully immerse themselves in a new city, live like a resident, and understand the problems that residents face on a daily basis that prevent them from accessing public transport, active commutes, or even safe outdoor spaces.\n\nThere’s also been a significant rise in micro-mobility—usage of e-bikes (e.g. CityBike rental services) and scooters (especially on college campuses) are growing. Research studies have shown that access to public transport, safe walking areas, and micro mobility all contribute to greater access of opportunity and successful mixed income neighborhoods, which can raise entire generations out of poverty. To continue this movement and translate this into economic mobility, we have to ensure urban developers are making space for car-alternatives in their city planning. This means bike lanes, bus stops, plaza’s, well-lit sidewalks, and green space in the city.\n\nThese reasons are why our team created CityGO—a tool that helps urban planners understand their region’s walkability scores down to the granular street intersection level and instantly visualize what a street would look like if it was actually walkable using Open AI's CLIP and DALL-E image generation tools (e.g. “What would the street in front of Painted Ladies look like if there were 2 bike lanes installed?)”\n\nWe are extremely intentional about the unseen effects of walkability on social structures, the environments, and public health and we are ecstatic to see the results: 1.Car-alternatives provide economic mobility as they give Americans alternatives to purchasing and maintaining cars that are cumbersome, unreliable, and extremely costly to maintain in dense urban areas. Having lower upfront costs also enables handicapped people, people that can’t drive, and extremely young/old people to have the same access to opportunity and continue living high quality lives. This disproportionately benefits people in poverty, as children with access to public transport or farther walking routes also gain access to better education, food sources, and can meet friends/share the resources of other neighborhoods which can have the huge impact of pulling communities out of poverty.\n\nPlacing bicycle lanes and barriers that protect cyclists from side traffic will encourage people to utilize micro mobility and active transport options. This is not possible if urban planners don’t know where existing transport is or even recognize the outsized impact of increased bike lanes.\n\nFinally, it’s no surprise that transportation as a sector alone leads to 27% of carbon emissions (US EPA) and is a massive safety issue that all citizens face everyday. Our country’s dependence on cars has been leading to deeper issues that affect basic safety, climate change, and economic mobility. The faster that we take steps to mitigate this dependence, the more sustainable our lifestyles and Earth can be."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"TLDR: 1) Map that pulls together data on car traffic and congestion, pedestrian foot traffic, and bike parking opportunities. Heat maps that represent the density of foot traffic and location-specific interactive markers. 2) Google Map Street View API enables urban planners to see and move through live imagery of their site. 3) OpenAI CLIP and DALL-E are used to incorporate an uploaded image (taken from StreetView) and descriptor text embeddings to accurately provide a hyper location-specific augmented image .\n\nThe exact street venues that are unwalkable in a city are extremely difficult to pinpoint. There’s an insane amount of data that you have to consolidate to get a cohesive image of a city’s walkability state at every point—from car traffic congestion, pedestrian foot traffic, bike parking, and more.\n\nBecause cohesive data collection is extremely important to produce a well-nuanced understanding of a place’s walkability, our team incorporated a mix of geoJSON data formats and vector tiles (specific to MapBox API). There was a significant amount of unexpected “data wrangling” that came from this project since multiple formats from various sources had to be integrated with existing mapping software—however, it was a great exposure to real issues data analysts and urban planners have when trying to work with data.\n\nThere are three primary layers to our mapping software: traffic congestion, pedestrian traffic, and bicycle parking.\n\nIn order to get the exact traffic congestion per street, avenue, and boulevard in San Francisco, we utilized a data layer in MapBox API. We specified all possible locations within SF and made requests for geoJSON data that is represented through each Marker. Green stands for low congestion, yellow stands for average congestion, and red stands for high congestion. This data layer was classified as a vector tile in MapBox API.\n\nConsolidating pedestrian foot traffic data was an interesting task to handle since this data is heavily locked in enterprise software tools. There are existing open source data sets that are posted by regional governments, but none of them are specific enough that they can produce 20+ or so heat maps of high foot traffic areas in a 15 mile radius. Thus, we utilized Best Time API to index for a diverse range of locations (e.g. restaurants, bars, activities, tourist spots, etc.) so our heat maps would not be biased towards a certain style of venue to capture information relevant to all audiences. We then cross-validated that data with Walk Score (the most trusted site for gaining walkability scores on specific addresses). We then ranked these areas and rendered heat maps on MapBox to showcase density.\n\nSan Francisco’s government open sources extremely useful data on all of the locations for bike parking installed in the past few years. We ensured that the data has been well maintained and preserved its quality over the past few years so we don’t over/underrepresent certain areas more than others. This was enforced by recent updates in the past 2 months that deemed the data accurate, so we added the geographic data as a new layer on our app. Each bike parking spot installed by the SF government is represented by a little bike icon on the map!\n\nThe most valuable feature is the user can navigate to any location and prompt CityGo to produce a hyper realistic augmented image resembling that location with added infrastructure improvements to make the area more walkable. Seeing the StreetView of that location, which you can move around and see real time information, and being able to envision the end product is the final bridge to an urban developer’s planning process, ensuring that walkability is within our near future."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We utilized the React framework to organize our project’s state variables, components, and state transfer. We also used it to build custom components, like the one that conditionally renders a live panoramic street view of the given location or render information retrieved from various data entry points.\n\nTo create the map on the left, our team used MapBox’s API to style the map and integrate the heat map visualizations with existing data sources. In order to create the markers that corresponded to specific geometric coordinates, we utilized Mapbox GL JS (their specific Javascript library) and third-party React libraries.\n\nTo create the Google Maps Panoramic Street View, we integrated our backend geometric coordinates to Google Maps’ API so there could be an individual rendering of each location. We supplemented this with third party React libraries for better error handling, feasibility, and visual appeal. The panoramic street view was extremely important for us to include this because urban planners need context on spatial configurations to develop designs that integrate well into the existing communities.\n\nWe created a custom function and used the required HTTP route (in PHP) to grab data from the Walk Score API with our JSON server so it could provide specific Walkability Scores for every marker in our map.\n\nText Generation from OpenAI’s text completion API was used to produce location-specific suggestions on walkability. Whatever marker a user clicked, the address was plugged in as a variable to a prompt that lists out 5 suggestions that are specific to that place within a 500-feet radius. This process opened us to the difficulties and rewarding aspects of prompt engineering, enabling us to get more actionable and location-specific than the generic alternative.\n\nAdditionally, we give the user the option to generate a potential view of the area with optimal walkability conditions using a variety of OpenAI models. We have created our own API using the Flask API development framework for Google Street View analysis and optimal scene generation.\n\nHere’s how we were able to get true image generation to work: When the user prompts the website for a more walkable version of the current location, we grab an image of the Google Street View and implement our own architecture using OpenAI contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) image and text encoders to encode both the image and a variety of potential descriptions describing the traffic, use of public transport, and pedestrian walkways present within the image. The outputted embeddings for both the image and the bodies of text were then compared with each other using scaled cosine similarity to output similarity scores. We then tag the image with the necessary descriptors, like classifiers,—this is our way of making the system understand the semantic meaning behind the image and prompt potential changes based on very specific street views (e.g. the Painted Ladies in San Francisco might have a high walkability score via the Walk Score API, but could potentially need larger sidewalks to further improve transport and the ability to travel in that region of SF). This is significantly more accurate than simply using DALL-E’s set image generation parameters with an unspecific prompt based purely on the walkability score because we are incorporating both the uploaded image for context and descriptor text embeddings to accurately provide a hyper location-specific augmented image.\n\nA descriptive prompt is constructed from this semantic image analysis and fed into DALLE, a diffusion based image generation model conditioned on textual descriptors. The resulting images are higher quality, as they preserve structural integrity to resemble the real world, and effectively implement the necessary changes to make specific locations optimal for travel.\n\nWe used Tailwind CSS to style our components."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"There were existing data bottlenecks, especially with getting accurate, granular, pedestrian foot traffic data.\n\nThe main challenge we ran into was integrating the necessary Open AI models + API routes. Creating a fast, seamless pipeline that provided the user with as much mobility and autonomy as possible required that we make use of not just the Walk Score API, but also map and geographical information from maps + google street view.\n\nProcessing both image and textual information pushed us to explore using the CLIP pre-trained text and image encoders to create semantically rich embeddings which can be used to relate ideas and objects present within the image to textual descriptions."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We could have done just normal image generation but we were able to detect car, people, and public transit concentration existing in an image, assign that to a numerical score, and then match that with a hyper-specific prompt that was generating an image based off of that information. This enabled us to make our own metrics for a given scene; we wonder how this model can be used in the real world to speed up or completely automate the data collection pipeline for local governments."},{"heading":"What we learned and what's next for CityGO","content":"Utilizing multiple data formats and sources to cohesively show up in the map + provide accurate suggestions for walkability improvement was important to us because data is the backbone for this idea. Properly processing the right pieces of data at the right step in the system process and presenting the proper results to the user was of utmost importance. We definitely learned a lot about keeping data lightweight, easily transferring between third-party softwares, and finding relationships between different types of data to synthesize a proper output.\n\nWe also learned quite a bit by implementing Open AI’s CLIP image and text encoders for semantic tagging of images with specific textual descriptions describing car, public transit, and people/people crosswalk concentrations. It was important for us to plan out a system architecture that effectively utilized advanced technologies for a seamless end-to-end pipeline. We learned about how information abstraction (i.e. converting between images and text and finding relationships between them via embeddings) can play to our advantage and utilizing different artificially intelligent models for intermediate processing.\n\nIn the future, we plan on integrating a better visualization tool to produce more realistic renders and introduce an inpainting feature so that users have the freedom to select a specific view on street view and be given recommendations + implement very specific changes incrementally. We hope that this will allow urban planners to more effectively implement design changes to urban spaces by receiving an immediate visual + seeing how a specific change seamlessly integrates with the rest of the environment.\n\nAdditionally we hope to do a neural radiance field (NERF) integration with the produced “optimal” scenes to give the user the freedom to navigate through the environment within the NERF to visualize the change (e.g. adding a bike lane or expanding a sidewalk or shifting the build site for a building). A potential virtual reality platform would provide an immersive experience for urban planners to effectively receive AI-powered layout recommendations and instantly visualize them.\n\nOur ultimate goal is to integrate an asset library and use NERF-based 3D asset generation to allow planners to generate realistic and interactive 3D renders of locations with AI-assisted changes to improve walkability. One end-to-end pipeline for visualizing an area, identifying potential changes, visualizing said changes using image generation + 3D scene editing/construction, and quickly iterating through different design cycles to create an optimal solution for a specific locations’ walkability as efficiently as possible!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api flask mapbox openai python react tailwind"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Fluent.ly","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/j-jzktbg","tagline":"Fluent.ly revolutionizes the ability to refine language ability.

This API gave us the ability to analyze voice patterns and fluency and transcribe passages that are mentioned in the application. Figuring out the documentation as well as how the AI will be interacting with the user was most important for us to execute properly since the AI would be acting as the tutor/mentor for the students in these cases. We developed a diagram that would break down the passages read to the student phonetically and give them a score of 100 for how well each word was pronounced based on the API’s internal grading system. As it is our first iteration of the web app, we wanted to explore how much information we could extract from the user to see what is most valuable to display to them in the future.\n\nIntegrating the API with the web host was a new feat for us as a young team. We were confident in our python abilities to host the AI services and found a library by the name of Flask that would help us write html and javascript code to help support the front end of the application through python. By using Flask, we were able to host our AI services with python while also continuously managing our front end through python scripts.\n\nThis gave room for the development of our backend systems which are Convex and Auth0. Auth0 was utilized to give members coming into the application a unique experience by having them sign into a personalized account. The account is then sent into the Convex database to be used as a storage base for their progress in learning and their development of skills over time. All in all, each component of the application from the AI learning models, generating custom passages for the user, to the backend that communicated between the Javascript and Python server host that streamlines the process of storing user data, came with its own challenges but came together seamlessly as we guide the user from our simple login system to the passage generator and speech analyzer to give the audience constructive feedback on their fluency and pronunciation."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"As a majority beginning team, this was our first time working with many of the different technologies, especially with AI APIs. We need to be patient working with key codes and going through an experiment process of trying different mini tests out to then head to the major goal that we were headed towards.

We found it hard to synthesize the analysis that was done by the AI to translate to the user to make sure they are confident in what they need to improve on. To solve this problem we first sought out how much information we could extract from the AI and then in future iterations we would simply display the output of feedback.\n\nAnother issue we ran into was the application of convex into the application. The major difficulty came from developing javascript functions that would communicate back to the python server hosting the site. This was resolved thankfully; we are grateful for the Convex mentors at the conference that helped us develop personalized javascript functions that work seamlessly with our Auth0 authentication and the rest of the application to record users that come and go."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of:","content":"One accomplishment that we are proud of was the implementation of Convex and Auth0 with Flask and Python.

According to a study by Johns Hopkins, medical errors are the third leading cause of death in the United States, after heart disease and cancer, with an estimated 250,000 deaths per year. These errors can occur due to various factors, including miscommunication and lack of complete patient information. Doctors have to go through piles of notes and patient histories, leading to time-consuming processes and increased risk of medical errors. By streamlining the conversation between doctors and patients and providing a clear overview of the patient's health status other relevant diagnosis information, Health Story aims to reduce the risk of medical errors and ultimately improve patient outcomes. Our mission is to make health management more efficient, effective, and safe for both doctors and patients.\n\nThe following are the facts that show how extreme this problem is:\n\nHaving hypertension puts you at risk for heart disease and stroke, which are leading causes of death in the United States.

Our app consists of multiple features as outlined below.\n\nSpeech2SOAP\n\nDoctors and nurses spend countless hours in writing medical notes, and summarizing them into the SOAP format (S-Subjective, O-Objective, A-Assessment, P-Plan). With a live transcription feature, doctors can now focus on their patients instead of taking notes. This feature not only transcribes the conversation, but also converts the conversation into a medical SOAP format which summarizes the patient's history over the last few visits, providing doctors with a quick and clear understanding of the patient's health status. We are different from existing solutions as we help the doctors find correlations and information that they need but cant find easily. We solve the 'tell me something I didn't know' problem.\n\nHealth Analyzer\n\nWe also integrate an analytics dashboard into our app which depicts a trend in vital health metrics (blood pressure, heart rate, etc), and provide \"smart\" comments on the inflection points in the patient's health trend over time. This enables the doctors to make more informed decisions and improve patient outcomes without having to sift through countless pages of notes.\n\nDrugs\n\nIt is crucial for the doctors to assess whether the patient is taking the right kind of medication in the right amount and at regular intervals. To help doctors make this assessment, we build a tracker which displays whether or not they have been taking the medications as prescribed based on the patient doctor conversation.\n\nTests\n\nIn this component, we display information regarding diagnostic tests that were conducted on the patient by different medical providers.

Research indicates that despite many verbal commitments to fish sustainably, one in five fish is illegally caught . What a load of carp!\n\nPeople are shellfish...\n\nAround the world, governments and NGOs have been trying to reel in overfishing, but economic incentives and self-interest mean that many ships continue to exploit resources secretly. It's hard to detect small ships on the world's 140 million square miles of ocean."},{"heading":"What we're shipping","content":"In short (we won't keep you on the hook): we used custom Stable Diffusion to create realistic synthetic image data of ships and trained a convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect and locate ships from satellite imagery. We also built a data visualization platform for stakeholders to monitor overfishing. To enhance this platform, we identified several hotspots of suspicious dark vessel activity by digging into 55,000+ AIS radar records.\n\nWhile people have tried to build AI models to detect overfishing before, accuracy was poor due to high class imbalance. There are few positive examples of ships on water compared to the infinite negative examples of patches of water without ships. Researchers have used GANs to generate synthetic data for other purposes. However, it takes around 50,000 sample images to train a decent GAN. The largest satellite ship dataset only has ~2,000 samples.\n\nWe realized that Stable Diffusion (SD), a popular text-to-image AI model, could be repurposed to generate unlimited synthetic image data of ships based on relatively few inputs. We were able to achieve highly realistic synthetic images using only 68 original images."},{"heading":"How we shipped it","content":"First, we read scientific literature and news articles about overfishing, methods to detect overfishing, and object detection models (and limitations). We identified a specific challenge: class imbalance in satellite imagery.\n\nNext, we split into teams. Molly and Soham worked on the front-end, developing a geographical analysis portal with React and creating a custom polygon renderer on top of existing geospatial libraries. Andrew and Sayak worked on curating satellite imagery from a variety of datasets, performing classical image transformations (rotations, flips, crops), fine-tuning Stable Diffusion models and GANs (to compare quality), and finally using a combo of real and synthetic data to train an CNN. Andrew also worked on design, graphics, and AIS data analysis. We explored Leap ML and Runway fine-tuning methods."},{"heading":"Challenges we tackled","content":"Building Earth visualization portals are always quite challenging, but we could never have predicted the waves we would face. Among animations, rotations, longitude, latitude, country and ocean lines, and the most-feared WebGL, we had a lot to learn. For ocean lines, we made an API call to a submarine transmissions library and recorded features to feed into a JSON. Inspired by the beautiful animated globes of Stripe's and CoPilot's landing pages alike, we challengingly but succeedingly wrote our own.\n\nAdditionally, the synthesis between globe to 3D map was difficult, as it required building a new scroll effect compatible with the globe. These challenges, although significant at the time, were ultimately surmountable, as we navigated through their waters unforgivingly. This enabled the series of accomplishments that ensued.\n\nIt was challenging to build a visual data analysis layer on top of the ArcGIS library. The library was extremely granular, requiring us to assimilate the meshes of each individual polygon to display. To overcome this, we built our own component-based layer that enabled us to draw on top of a preexisting map."},{"heading":"Making waves (accomplishments)","content":"Text-to-image models are really cool but have failed to find that many real-world use cases besides art and profile pics. We identified and validated a relevant application for Stable Diffusion that has far-reaching effects for agricultural, industry, medicine, defense, and more.\n\nWe also made a sleek and refined web portal to display our results, in just a short amount of time. We also trained a CNN to detect ships using the real and synthetic data that achieved 96% accuracy."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"How to tackle overfishing:\n\nWe learned a lot about existing methods to combat overfishing that we didn't know about. We really became more educated on ocean sustainability practices and the pressing nature of the situation. We schooled ourselves on AIS, satellite imagery, dark vessels, and other relevant topics.\n\nDon't cast a wide net. And don't go overboard.\n\nOriginally, we were super ambitious with what we wanted to do, such as implementing Monte Carlo particle tracking algorithms to build probabilistic models of ship trajectories. We realized that we should really focus on a couple of ideas at max because of time constraints.\n\nDivide and conquer\n\nWe also realized that splitting into sub-teams of two to work on specific tasks and being clear about responsibilities made things go very smoothly.\n\nGeographic data visualization\n\nBuilding platforms that enable interactions with maps and location data."},{"heading":"What's on the horizon (implications + next steps)","content":"Our Stable Diffusion data augmentation protocol has implications for few-shot learning of any object for agricultural, defense, medical and other applications. For instance, you could use our method to generate synthetic lung CT-Scan data to train cancer detection models or fine-tune a model to detect a specific diseased fruit not covered by existing general-purpose models.\n\nWe plan to create an API that allows anyone to upload a few photos of a specific object. We will build a large synthetic image dataset based off of those objects and train a plug-and-play CNN API that performs object location, classification, and counting.\n\nWhile general purpose object detection models like YOLO work well for popular and broad categories like \"bike\" or \"dog\", they aren't feasible for specific detection purposes. For instance, if you are a farmer trying to use computer vision to detect diseased lychees. Or a medical researcher trying to detect cancerous cells from a microscope slide. Our method allows anyone to obtain an accurate task-specific object detection model. Because one-size-fits-all doesn't cut it.\n\nWe're excited to turn the tide with our fin-tech!\n\nHow many fish/ocean-related puns did you find?"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"chakra folium keras multiprocessing nextjs numpy openai opencv pandas pillow python react stablediffusion tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"shipsense.app github.com docs.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"ControlDB","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/controldb","tagline":"Accelerating access to web3 data storage at scale. 100X cheaper, more secure, more persistent than existing cloud data providers.

Files are sharded across multiple nodes. Building on this protocol allows ControlDB to fundamentally ensure user data remains decentralized, preventing a single source of failure because of IPFS' distributed nature.\n\n❌ A limitation of IPFS, however, is that shards of files are made public.\n\n✅ To overcome this, ControlDB adds an additional layer of encryption to further increase user privacy. In the event that a user's IPFS hash is intercepted, an attacker will still have to circumvent the additional layer of advanced encryption, keeping users' data safe.\n\n❌ IPFS also has no inherent read or write controls, necessary for handling sensitive data across multiple agents, for example in healthcare.\n\n✅ Here ControlDB introduces a permission layer onto files, allowing admins to designate different levels of file access across multiple stakeholders with varied roles.\n\n❌ IPFS is also accessed through command line interface, making it hard to debug and understand.\n\n✅ In contrast ControlDB adds a user-friendly GUI on top of IPFS’ command line based function, allowing non-technical users to access its features. A simplified API makes it easy and quick for developers to implement ControlDB’s file storage into their programs. Doing so circumvents the need for developers to build a new IPFS pipeline, reducing the barrier to entry for smaller and/or less experienced teams.\n\n✅ Our architecture is designed to be plug-and-play, which means that you can easily switch between different storage endpoints, such as IPFS or Estuary or any other option where you just need to add a configuration file, depending on your needs. This provides you with the flexibility to use the database of your choice, while still taking advantage of our platform's powerful features.\n\n🔥🔥🔥 Altogether ControlDB will save developers significant amounts of time, money and technical headache, allowing them to scale usage from simple to complex use cases as their software grows.\n\n😌😌😌 It will also improve the availability of files, reduce privacy concerns, and grant users increased control over their data."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"🛠️ ControlDB was built with TypeScript and Golang. Its MVP consists of a fully functional backend with full encryption, decryption and sharding across multiple nodes implemented, as well as a fully functional frontend with login, file upload and retrieval. We even built a working user interface.\n\n🤝🏻 Yes, everything is fully working . 🫡🫡🫡\n\nTechnical Architecture\n\nOverall Architecture\n\nWe have an API Server which interacts with the Node Cluster which is a wrapper to any decentralised storage system. We spun up 3 IPFS nodes locally which are used as the decentralised storage engine.\n\nNo code frontend tool Our front end allows users to easily upload their data onto decentralised file storage quickly without any hassle or code.\n\nAPI Server\n\nAPI Server: This layer accepts user requests via our Frontend as well as the HTTP API requests. The permissions are fetched out of payload which user sent and then the main data is used for the further part.\n\nMiddleware Node Cluster\n\nMiddleware Node: A search engine is developed in this layer using B+ Trees for faster retrieval of data and lookup. As the data is received from the user, we encrypt it using AES-256 and generate the encryption key. A unique id is also generated in this node which will be used as a key for insertion in the B+ Tree. The package of permissions, encryption key and IPFS Hash is generated for the insertion in B+ Trees.\n\nIPFS Nodes We have started 3 IPFS nodes which interacts with our middleware node.\n\nFirstly, IPFS is installed on the operating system by following the official IPFS documentation. This step provides the necessary software to create and manage the IPFS cluster.\n\nNext, IPFS is initialized on each node using the ipfs init command, which creates configuration files for ipfs-cluster-ctl to interact with the nodes. This step is essential to ensure that the IPFS nodes are ready to be managed by the cluster.\n\nA configuration file is created using the default docker-compose.yml file, or a custom configuration file can be used to set up the cluster. The configuration file specifies how many IPFS cluster nodes and Kubo nodes are to be created, which determines the cluster's capacity and the method of interaction with the nodes.\n\nThe Kubo nodes sit on top of the IPFS cluster nodes and provide a way for users to interact with the cluster via HTTP API or IPFS client. This interaction enables users to manage and control the IPFS cluster by creating endpoints that allow various actions to be performed on the nodes.\n\nOnce the cluster is set up, users can create endpoints to perform various actions on the cluster nodes. These endpoints can be migrated as necessary, enabling the cluster to be flexible and adaptable to changing requirements."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"🧐 At first, the team struggled with ideation, and considered a broad spectrum of potential pathways. There was a struggle to find consensus. We also had little to no experience with IPFS, and no idea how to architect or scope it down. This was overcome with much discussion and research.\n\nChallenges we ran into:\n\nDeveloping the ACL and integrating it with the IPFS. Starting the local IPFS architecture. As we were running the local IPFS server, we faced the CORS issue in the IPFS nodes which prevented us to access from different origins. Developing B+ search tree as per our use case of adding multiple values. Integration of different components we built. Integration with Estuary APIs for using them as the storage engine along with IPFS."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"🙏🏻 We are incredibly proud to achieve a fully functional MVP within 36 hours.

She spoke with locals, meeting a grandmother carrying a baby whose father was lost in the rubble when she was only 10 days old. Fast forward to today, the death tolls are now in the tens of thousands due to the Turkey-Syria earthquakes, with at least 20,000 victims still lying beneath the rubble. More than 6,000 buildings collapsed in the region, but a lot of the damage could have been prevented with better infrastructure monitoring.\n\nThese earthquakes were extremely deadly because these cities did not enforce building codes or treat safe housing as a human right (Vox News). Construction companies have been cutting corners and ignoring building codes for decades, and the government often just lets it slide.\n\nThrough researching current processes rescue teams use to help on-site, we started piecing together how impactful drones can be in this space.

For example, a search-and-rescue official’s workflow could be [search(”people in rubble”), map/locate() results]. Our goal is to eliminate overhead and allow any users to efficiently comb through drone image data to make informed decisions.\n\nDuring the hackathon, we focused on connecting drone images to semantic search, using OpenAI’s Clip neural network that brings together text and images.

It was super inspiring to learn about how fast the industry is advancing and see how passionate their teams were about their technology. Disaster Management : We learned so much about the problems surrounding disaster management and narrowed down one of the major pain points– bad infrastructure. It was disappointing to hear that many of the lives lost in these natural disasters were very preventable if all parties acted ethically from the start. OpenAI CLIP Model : Most models like ChatGPT use only one form of input: text. OpenAI’s CLIP model is one of the first to effectively connect images and text by embedding them in the same vector space. This allows us to basically map out not only how close images are to each other in meaning, but also how close they are to words and phrases. Treehacks was the first time we’ve worked with an existing ML model with pre-trained weights—setting up was definitely a challenge. Image search : We learned that image search is hard to do. We considered alternative image search approaches, like using keywords, or other current AI methods. However, the CLIP model seemed to be the highest performing one. At the moment, CLIP performs well out-of-the-box without fine tuning. In the future, we see ways to improve the search by training CLIP further."},{"heading":"Future","content":"There are lots of interesting possibilities for the future. After we create the automated workflow platform, we can expand to different customer bases. Farmers can create workflows to monitor their land (identify areas with pests, monitor soil moisture, track movement and health of livestock) and alert relevant teams. City planners can create workflows to monitor urban growth, detect poor infrastructure, and report any damage. Construction workers can create workflows to send their drones on routine checkups, inspect infrastructure for potential problems, and send alerts to intervening teams.\n\nBusiness Model\n\nThe current plan is a freemium approach, where we give away free 1GB accounts and charge for # of users, additional storage, number of integrations, and/or computer power. We plan on first giving our platform for free out to disaster managers so they can setup their workflows and start using it for prevention methods. This way they are setup for success in the case that disaster strikes.\n\nThe global disaster management market is expected to grow to 5.2 billion by 2027. The global agricultural drone market is expected to reach USD 1.7 billion by 2025, and the global market for urban planning is expected to reach USD 7.6 billion by 2027. In addition, with the rise of extreme climate events, the need for disaster relief software and tools will only grow.\n\nAutomating workflows for the current existing manual processes in these fields will save immense time that is currently being used to do mundane, repetitive, logistical tasks, giving back time to spend on growth and innovation. Though money is important to run a business, we’re currently focused on saving critical time from disaster managers who will in turn be able to save more lives."},{"heading":"Ethics","content":"We strongly believe that governments should treat safe housing as a human right. After doing a lot of research into the space, we learned that construction companies have been cutting corners and ignoring building codes for decades, and the government often just lets it slide. This was one of the biggest reasons for the high death count after the recent earthquake in Turkey and Syria.\n\nIt’s ethically wrong for us as a society to allow people living in bad infrastructure to constantly be in worry about their livelihood. Or worse, not even realize how dangerous their living situation is. Thus, for this hackathon, we focused on safety because it was the most high-impact in saving lives.\n\nThe first step we took was building out the drone image search, giving disaster managers a quick way to sort through their large datasets. Not only will this be extremely useful post-disaster to filter out data, but also to help identify bad infrastructure areas and notify those in the area before it’s too late.\n\nAlly makes drone data management simple and easily accessible for non-technical users. With such a high-impact space, there exist many ethical issues to further explore:\n\nPrivacy is an especially important consideration when using drones for data collection. The data collected by drones can be used to monitor people without their knowledge or consent, or to gain access to sensitive information. To ensure privacy, drones should only be used with explicit consent and with appropriate oversight or regulation. Additionally, all data collected should be treated with the utmost respect for the rights and privacy of the people involved. Accuracy is also a key ethical concern when using drones for data collection. If the data and images collected are not accurate, then decisions made based on this data could be wrong or misguided. To ensure accuracy, the designers of the drones must ensure that the automated workflows and algorithms used are reliable and effective. Safety and security are also important ethical considerations when using drones for data collection. If the data is used for disaster relief, for example, then there is the potential for drones to crash or malfunction, endangering the people in the area. Additionally, drone data is vulnerable to hacking, potentially leading to a breach of confidential information. To ensure safety and security, designers must ensure that the drones are equipped with appropriate safeguards and that the data collected is encrypted. Reliability is a major ethical consideration when using drones for data collection. If the automated workflows are not reliable, then the data collected could be inaccurate and ineffective for decision making.

We would also seek to expand the project to alternate versions adapted for the comfort of the users, for example, a simplified iOS version could be used by public speakers to keep notes on their speech and let them know if they're speaking too fast, too slow, or articulating correctly live! Similarly, such a feature would be integrated into the VR version, so a presenter could have notes on their podium and media to present behind them (powerpoint, video, etc.), simulating an even more realistic presenting experience. Another idea is adding a multiplayer version that would exponentially expand the uses for ArticuLab.

The backend solution allows the connection of available compute resource to a requesting user. Since convex uses web sockets under the hood, we were able to leverage real-time reactive updates. This also allowed a two-way communication from the server to the client and the client to the server. It was imperative to send updates from the backend side to the client. Convex simplified the necessary logic and infrastructure that would've been required to make this possible - the web sockets solution was a game-changing asset.

We elected to utilize the ubiquitous nature of transcripts. Utilizing python we parse a transcript, sending the data to a node.js server which serves as a REST api point for our front end. We chose Vercel to deploy our website. It was necessary to generate a large number of sample users in order to test our project. To generate the users, we needed to scrape the Stanford course library to build a wide variety of classes to assign to our generated users. In order to provide more robust tests, we built our generator to pick a certain major or category of classes, while randomly assigning different category classes for a probabilistic percentage of classes. Using this python library, we are able to generate robust and dense networks to test our graph connection score and visualization.\n\nBackend Infrastructure\n\nWe needed a robust database infrastructure in order to handle the thousands of nodes. We elected to explore two options for storing our graphs and files: Firebase and Estuary. We utilized the Estuary API to store transcripts and the graph “fingerprints” that represented a students course identity. We wanted to take advantage of the web3 storage as this would allow students to permanently store their course identity to be easily accessed. We also made use of Firebase to store the dynamic nodes and connections between courses and classes.\n\nWe distributed our workload across several servers. We utilized Nginx to deploy a production level python server that would perform the graph operations described below and a development level python server. We also had a Node.js server to serve as a proxy serving as a REST api endpoint, and Vercel hosted our front-end.\n\nGraph Construction\n\nTreating the firebase database as the source of truth, we query it to get all user data, namely their usernames and which classes they took in which quarters. Taking this data, we constructed a graph in Python using networkX, in which each person and course is a node with a type label “user” or “course” respectively. In this graph, we then added edges between every person and every course they took, with the edge weight corresponding to the recency of their having taken it.\n\nSince we have thousands of nodes, building this graph is an expensive operation. Hence, we leverage Firebase’s key-value storage format to cache this base graph in a JSON representation, for quick and easy I/O. When we add a user, we read in the cached graph, add the user, and update the graph. For all graph operations, the cache reduces latency from ~15 seconds to less than 1.\n\nWe compute similarity scores between all users based on their course history. We do so as the sum of two components: node embeddings and domain-specific heuristics. To get robust, informative, and inductive node embeddings, we periodically train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) using PyG (PyTorch Geometric). This training is unsupervised as the GAT aims to classify positive and negative edges. While we experimented with more classical approaches such as Node2Vec, we ultimately use a GAT as it is inductive, i.e. it can generalize to and embed new nodes without retraining. Additionally, with their attention mechanism, we better account for structural differences in nodes by learning more dynamic importance weighting in neighborhood aggregation. We augment the cosine similarity between two users’ node embeddings with some more interpretable heuristics, namely a recency-weighted sum of classes in common over a recency-weighted sum over the union of classes taken.\n\nWith this rich graph representation, when a user queries, we return the induced subgraph of the user, their neighbors, and the top k most people most similar to them, who they likely have a lot in common with, and whom they may want to meet!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We chose a somewhat complicated stack with multiple servers.

An internal ultrasound is a common method of examination; however, they are not recommended for women younger than 20 years, thus making PCOS difficult to spot in early adulthood.\n\nThe reality is that many people go undiagnosed. In a study done by Monash Centre for Health Research and Implementation, researchers found that people who have PCOS commonly reported that they were unsatisfied with their overall diagnosis experience, including the information provided about the condition, the number of health professionals they had to see, and the wait time for diagnosis. PCOS affects physical health and mental well-being over the life span, and a delay in diagnosis can exacerbate these effects and even lead to more long-term health complications.\n\nAs someone who is experiencing the difficulties associated with PCOS, I wanted to come up with an application that could assist in the diagnosis process."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Anyone can have access to a questionnaire that will calculate the risk or likelihood of having PCOS, there is a log-in feature using authentication and logged in users will have access to other parts of the website."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"I utilized a dataset that has different fields containing symptoms or conditions that could be useful to predict PCOS, such as ovarian follicle size, cycle length, and whether the patient has an irregular cycle.

[2]\n\nEvery year, nearly 400,000 hospitalized patients suffer from medical harm that could have been avoided. [3] Errors in medical practice contribute to approximately $20 billion in costs each year. [4] Medical errors in hospitals and clinics contribute to approximately 100,000 deaths each year. [5]\n\nAs a result, there remains an urgent need for research to identify the predictors of diagnostic errors in order to develop effective interventions that can improve diagnostic accuracy, preventing these errors from occurring in the first place."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"ForeStall works to predict potential diagnosis errors through analyzing a patient’s risk level to a certain medication at both a macro and micro scale. The interface provides a searchable macro dashboard that identifies high risk patients across entire hospitals, while its micro dashboard identifies high risk patients for individual practitioners.\n\nForeStall finds mappings of allergies to medication as well as mappings of medications that are incompatible, then uses a function that takes in the allergies of patients as parameters and outputs non-compatible medications. Given a patient’s profile (age, weight, sex) and a medication that they are taking. ForeStall uses InterSystems Integrated ML to output a patient’s risk level and other high risk medications (that are not definitively known as incompatible). High risk is identified by calculating potential combinations of allergies that have overlapping drug instances, which could potentially lead to fatal results for patients.\n\nMedical errors commonly occur through patient misidentification, wrong dosage regimen, and wrong medication administration; ForeStall mitigates these issues through clear, clickable profiles that identify each patient with multiple factors (photo, age, sex, demographic) and provide detailed, easy-to-understand medication information for practitioners. Each patient profile includes a thread of patient notes so that practitioners can remain on the same page when a patient is passed down.\n\nForeStall also introduces an anonymous error reporting feature, addressing the stigma of not reporting medical errors due to fear of backlash. This function will mitigate future medical errors, as multiple studies have identified that if error-prone situations are reported and managed by a modification of the system, a decrease in the frequency of the error and concomitant errors will ensue."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our team built an innovative machine learning model that predicts the risk of severity of drug adverse effects. We started by querying 100,000 patient drug adverse effect profiles from the openFDA database, and then extracted and used patient demographic information, medications, and reported symptoms. We created a scale from 1 to 5 to assess the severity of adverse effects, ranging from low severity to death. Using Intersystems Integrated ML, we trained an optimized model with the top 50 most common symptoms and the top 50 most commonly prescribed drugs in the dataset. Our team spent considerable time fine-tuning the model and trying various configurations, which ultimately paid off. We achieved a remarkable predictive power of 73% of the variance. Overall, we built a refined model that will help healthcare professionals assess the risk of drug adverse effects, which could have a significant impact on patient care and safety. In addition to building the backend machine learning model, our team also implemented the frontend. To begin, we used Figma to create wireframes that allowed us to visualize the layout and design of the website. We then used React.js to develop the frontend, which included a user-friendly interface for healthcare professionals to input patient information and receive predictions about the severity of potential drug adverse effects. One of the key features of the website was the use of generative AI to create patient medical profiles. This allowed us to generate realistic and detailed profiles that could be used to demonstrate the functionality of the website. Throughout the development process, we focused on creating a clean and intuitive design that would be easy to use for healthcare professionals of all levels of technical expertise."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The first and foremost challenge we encountered was wrangling the data set, which involved querying the openFDA API, understanding the JSON elements, and extracting essential calls for the machine learning (ML) model. The difficulty was that we had to represent adverse drug effects quantitatively in a way that could be incorporated effectively into an ML model. Additionally, determining the most common drugs and reactions, as well as deciding on the optimal number of drugs and reactions to include in the model, was a complex undertaking due to the large number of unique drugs (3176 unique drugs and 2286 different adverse reactions across the dataset)/\n\nMoreover, we had to learn SQL on the fly and become proficient in InterSystem's API. Learning InterSystem was particularly challenging because we had to iteratively conform the data preprocessing to the environment and data formatting requirements of InterSystem. Finally, after trying multiple different models with varying combinations of reactions, drugs, and model configurations, we had to figure out the optimal model to increase predictive power from 2% to 73% of the variance. The biggest challenge we faced was connecting the different components of our project, as each aspect required different technical skills and expertise. Despite these challenges, we adapted to the pressure of the tight timeline and completed our project through perseverance and collaboration."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud of creating an app with the potential to save lives through harnessing ML.

With this goal, Whisker Workshops sets out to preserve precious machine learning insights while replacing formidable blocks of code and equations with cute hand-drawn graphics and games."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Whisker Workshops consists of two main playground sections: one allows students to interactively build a neural network to represent the nonlinear exclusive or (XOR) gate while the other allows users to explore various dimensionality reduction levels for principal component analysis (PCA). We designed the UI to be cute and hand-drew graphics down to the buttons, aiming to foster a friendly and welcoming environment for beginners.\n\nFor the XOR gate playground, the truth table for the logic gate is given (no prior experience is assumed) — the goal is then to create a network to reproduce XOR. The playground is very visual: the user can see the entire neural network in real-time while updating neurons and edges. Edge weights can be updated by clicking on them, and the thickness of an edge visualizes its corresponding weight; the number of neurons is adjustable through a slider. Then, the player can run the network on different inputs and see how well they do: the task is essentially presented as a game of sorts!\n\nThe PCA playground (also known as “More Isn’t Always Better”) follows a similar visual philosophy: users can change the dimensionality of input data (Fashion MNIST dataset, images of clothes and accessories) and visualize how well the model performs through an interactive chart. Our friendly cat mentor also guides us through the entire process and explains why we observe the results we do!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"All of the graphics and artwork in the final product were drawn by our team and incorporated into the website frontend built in React.JS and CSS.\n\nThe PCA playground was built by first conducting principal component analysis in Python on the Fashion MNIST dataset for a variety of output dimensionalities. We then used InterSystems IntegratedML to train a machine learning model for each of the resulting datasets. Through this process, we were delightfully surprised by the versatility of InterSystems IntegratedML’s capabilities. Not only was the model able to predict the 2-way XOR task, a classic non-linearity test, but it was also able to perform quite well on classifying MNIST fashion pieces, with no knowledge of what the input was.\n\nThe resulting accuracy data was then visualized through Chart.JS, a data visualization library in Javascript. The cat animations and dialogue were all created in CSS.\n\nThe XOR gate playground was designed primarily in React.JS, using a lot of different state logic and hooks to create the interactive neural network editor and interface for running the model. Due to the highly custom nature of the project, we manually implemented forward propagation for the network. All styling was done in CSS."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"It was often difficult to create certain visual designs, effects and features with CSS: for example, the slider that demonstrates the results of Principal Component Analysis for different output dimensions. This was especially the case for importing our custom graphics and artwork into our project. This improved our debugging skills significantly and also taught us how to better utilize documentation to learn.\n\nAnother challenge we faced was navigating and running models on IntegratedML. We are very grateful for Thomas from Intersystems for his exceedingly helpful advice, allowing us to successfully train and validate the models we needed."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re proud of having built a functional application with real-world value during this hackathon.

Our team is also proud to have explored and combined skills from a lot of different fields including machine learning, web development, data analysis, and graphic design.\n\nAnother accomplishment that we feel proud of is the fact that we incorporated the InterSystems IntegratedML framework into our project as this took us a lot of effort and research."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to make a stylish and customized UI and utilize CSS to its fullest extent; along with incorporating custom graphic design, we learned to create a product that would appeal to our target audience: children without technical knowledge interested in exploring machine learning. Thinking about our target audience was a skill we improved a lot throughout TreeHacks as we continually aimed to look at our product from users’ perspective.\n\nUsing InterSystems IntegratedML also taught us how to effectively use external tools to help build our product. Through the process, we had to read a lot of documentation and learn to understand the new paradigm presented by this specific system — this is a skill that is essential as programmers always use different tools and technologies to assist them.\n\nWe were also puzzled as to how to efficiently run the machine learning algorithm in real time after each update made by the user without taking a toll on the user’s computer or taking too long. We learned how to custom-build a machine learning algorithm without the conventional tools such as Tensorflow or Pytorch, which would be too inefficient to run each time. We eventually accomplished this by extracting only the features essential to the differentiation task with principal component analysis, and then coding up our own dense network."},{"heading":"What's next for Whisker Workshop","content":"We plan to expand this concept of abstractified ML to middle school and high school students who don’t have access to machine learning education.

We wondered if and how we can apply conversational AI technology such as chatbots to benefit people, especially those who may be underprivileged or underserviced in several areas that are within the potential influence of this technology. We were brooding over the six tracks and various sponsor rewards when inspiration struck. We wanted to make a chatbot within healthcare, specifically patient safety. Being international students, we recognize some of the difficulties that arise when living in a foreign country in terms of language and the ability to communicate with others. Through this empathetic process, we arrived at a group that we defined as the target audience of MediBot; children and non-native English speakers who face language barriers and interpretive difficulties in their communication with healthcare professionals. We realized very early on that we do not want to replace the doctor in diagnosis but rather equip our target audience with the ability to express their symptoms clearly and accurately. After some deliberation, we decided that the optimal method to accomplish that using conversational AI was through implementing a chatbot that asks clarifying questions to help label the symptoms for the users."},{"heading":"What it does:","content":"Medibot initially prompts users to describe their symptoms as best as they can. The description is then evaluated to compare to a list of proper medical terms (symptoms) in terms of similarity. Suppose those symptom descriptions are rather vague (do not match very well with the list of official symptoms or are blanket terms). In that case, Medibot asks the patients clarifying questions to identify the symptoms with the user’s added input. For example, when told, “My head hurts,” Medibot will ask them to distinguish between headaches, migraines, or potentially blunt force trauma. But if the descriptions of a symptom are specific and relatable to official medical terms, Medibot asks them questions regarding associated symptoms. This means Medibot presents questions inquiring about symptoms that are known probabilistically to appear with the ones the user has already listed. The bot is designed to avoid making an initial diagnosis using a double-blind inquiry process to control for potential confirmation biases. This means the bot will not tell the doctor its predictions regarding what the user has, and it will not nudge the users into confessing or agreeing to a symptom they do not experience. Instead, the doctor will be given a list of what the user was likely describing at the end of the conversation between the bot and the user. The predictions from the inquiring process are a product of the consideration of associative relationships among symptoms. Medibot keeps track of the associative relationship through Cosine Similarity and weight distribution after the Vectorization Encoding Process. Over time, Medibot zones in on a specific condition (determined by the highest possible similarity score). The process also helps in maintaining context throughout the chat conversations. Finally, the conversation between the patient and Medibot ends in the following cases: the user needs to leave, the associative symptoms process suspects one condition much more than the others, and the user finishes discussing all symptoms they experienced."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We constructed the MediBot web application in two different and interconnected stages, frontend and backend. The front end is a mix of ReactJS and HTML. There is only one page accessible to the user which is a chat page between the user and the bot. The page was made reactive through several styling options and the usage of states in the messages. The back end was constructed using Python, Flask, and machine learning models such as OpenAI and Hugging Face. The Flask was used in communicating between the varying python scripts holding the MediBot response model and the chat page in the front end. Python was the language used to process the data, encode the NLP models and their calls, and store and export responses. We used prompt engineering through OpenAI to train a model to ask clarifying questions and perform sentiment analysis on user responses. Hugging Face was used to create an NLP model that runs a similarity check between the user input of symptoms and the official list of symptoms."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our first challenge was familiarizing ourselves with virtual environments and solving dependency errors when pushing and pulling from GitHub. Each of us initially had different versions of Python and operating systems. We quickly realized that this will hinder our progress greatly after fixing the first series of dependency issues and started coding in virtual environments as solutions. The second great challenge we ran into was integrating the three separate NLP models into one application. This is because they are all resource intensive in terms of ram and we only had computers with around 12GB free for coding. To circumvent this we had to employ intermediate steps when feeding the result from one model into the other and so on. Finally, the third major challenge was resting and sleeping well."},{"heading":"Accomplishments we are proud of","content":"First and foremost we are proud of the fact that we have a functioning chatbot that accomplishes what we originally set out to do. In this group 3 of us have never coded an NLP model and the last has only coded smaller scale ones. Thus the integration of 3 of them into one chatbot with front end and back end is something that we are proud to have accomplished in the timespan of the hackathon. Second, we are happy to have a relatively small error rate in our model. We informally tested it with varied prompts and performed within expectations every time."},{"heading":"What we learned:","content":"This was the first hackathon for half of the team, and for 3/4, it was the first time working with virtual environments and collaborating using Git. We learned quickly how to push and pull and how to commit changes. Before the hackathon, only one of us had worked on an ML model, but we learned together to create NLP models and use OpenAI and prompt engineering (credits to OpenAI Mem workshop). This project's scale helped us understand these ML models' intrinsic moldability. Working on Medibot also helped us become much more familiar with the idiosyncrasies of ReactJS and its application in tandem with Flask for dynamically changing webpages. As mostly beginners, we experienced our first true taste of product ideation, project management, and collaborative coding environments."},{"heading":"What’s next for MediBot","content":"The next immediate steps for MediBot involve making the application more robust and capable. In more detail, first we will encode the ability for MediBot to detect and define more complex language in simpler terms. Second, we will improve upon the initial response to allow for more substantial multi-symptom functionality.Third, we will expand upon the processing of qualitative answers from users to include information like length of pain, the intensity of pain, and so on. Finally, after this more robust system is implemented, we will begin the training phase by speaking to healthcare providers and testing it out on volunteers."},{"heading":"Ethics:","content":"Our design aims to improve patients’ healthcare experience towards the better and bridge the gap between a condition and getting the desired treatment. We believe expression barriers and technical knowledge should not be missing stones in that bridge. The ethics of our design therefore hinges around providing quality healthcare for all. We intentionally stopped short of providing a diagnosis with Medibot because of the following ethical considerations:\n\nBias Mitigation: Whatever diagnosis we provide might induce unconscious biases like confirmation or availability bias, affecting the medical provider’s ability to give proper diagnosis. It must be noted however, that Medibot is capable of producing diagnosis. Perhaps, Medibot can be used in further research to ensure the credibility of AI diagnosis by checking its prediction against the doctor’s after diagnosis has been made. Patient trust and safety: We’re not yet at the point in our civilization’s history where patients are comfortable getting diagnosis from AIs. Medibot’s intent is to help nudge us a step down that path, by seamlessly, safely, and without negative consequence integrating AI within the more physical, intimate environments of healthcare. We envision Medibot in these hospital spaces, helping users articulate their symptoms better without fear of getting a wrong diagnosis. We’re humans, we like when someone gets us, even if that someone is artificial.\n\nHowever, the implementation of AI for pre-diagnoses still raises many ethical questions and considerations:\n\nFairness: Use of Medibot requires a working knowledge of the English language. This automatically disproportionates its accessibility. There are still many immigrants for whom the questions, as simple as we have tried to make them, might be too much for. This is a severe limitation to our ethics of assisting these people. A next step might include introducing further explanation of troublesome terms in their language (Note: the process of pre-diagnosis will remain in English, only troublesome terms that the user cannot understand in English may be explained in a more familiar language. This way we further build patients’ vocabulary and help their familiarity with English ). There are also accessibility concerns as hospitals in certain regions or economic stratas may not have the resources to incorporate this technology. Bias: We put severe thought into bias mitigation both on the side of the doctor and the patient. It is important to ensure that Medibot does not lead the patient into reporting symptoms they don’t necessarily have or induce availability bias. We aimed to circumvent this by asking questions seemingly randomly from a list of symptoms generated based on our Sentence Similarity model. This avoids leading the user in just one direction. However, this does not eradicate all biases as associative symptoms are hard to mask from the patient (i.e a patient may think chills if you ask about cold) so this remains a consideration. Accountability: Errors in symptom identification can be tricky to detect making it very hard for the medical practitioner to know when the symptoms are a true reflection of the actual patient’s state. Who is responsible for the consequences of wrong pre-diagnoses? It is important to establish these clear systems of accountability and checks for detecting and improving errors in MediBot. Privacy: MediBot will be trained on patient data and patient-doctor diagnoses in future operations. There remains concerns about privacy and data protection. This information, especially identifying information, must be kept confidential and secure. One method of handling this is asking users at the very beginning whether they want their data to be used for diagnostics and training or not."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"chatbot flask healthcare intersystems javascript natural-language-processing nltk openai python react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Amanuensis","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/amanuensis","tagline":"AI-enabled physician assistant for automated clinical summarization and question generation.

Although the EHR represents a valuable resource to track clinical care and retrospectively evaluate clinical decision-making, the data deluge of the EHR often obfuscates key pieces of information necessary for the physician to make an accurate diagnosis and devise an effective treatment plan (Noori and Magdamo et al. ). Physicians may struggle to rapidly synthesize the lengthy medical histories of their patients; in the absence of data-driven strategies to extract relevant insights from the EHR, they are often forced to rely on intuition alone to generate patient questions. Further, the EHR search interface is rarely optimized for the physician search workflow, and manual search can be both time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nThe volume and complexity of the EHR can lead to missed opportunities for physicians to gather critical information pertinent to patient health, leading to medical errors or poor health outcomes. It is imperative to design tools and services to reduce the burden of manual EHR search on physicians and help them elicit the most relevant information from their patients."},{"heading":"About Amanuensis 📝","content":"Amanuensis is an AI-enabled physician assistant for automated clinical summarization and question generation. By arming physicians with relevant insights collected from the EHR as well as with patient responses to NLP-generated questions, we empower physicians to achieve more accurate diagnoses and effective treatment plans. The Amanuensis pipeline is as follows:\n\nClinical Summarization: Through our web application, physicians can access medical records of each of their patients, where they are first presented with a clinical summary: a concise, high-level overview of the patient's medical history, including key information such as diagnoses, medications, and allergies. This clinical summary is automatically generated by Amanuensis using Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), an autoregressive language model with a 2048-token-long context and 175 billion parameters. The clinical summary may be reviewed by the physician to ensure that the summary is accurate and relevant to the patient's health. Question Generation: Next, Amanuensis uses GPT-3 to automatically generate a list of questions that the physician can ask their patient to elicit more information and identify relevant information in the EHR that the physician may not have considered. The NLP-generated questions are automatically sent to the patient prior to their appointment ( e.g. , once the appointment is scheduled); then, the physician can review the patient's responses and use them to inform their clinical decision-making during the subsequent encounter. Importantly, we have tested Amanuensis on a large cohort of high-quality simulated EHRs generated by Synthea TM .\n\nBy guiding doctors to elicit the most relevant information from their patients, Amanuensis can help physicians improve patient outcomes and reduce the incidences of all five types of medical errors: medication errors, patient care complications, procedure/surgery complications, infections, and diagnostic/treatment errors."},{"heading":"Building Process 🏗","content":"To both construct and validate Amanuensis, we used the Synthea TM library to generate synthetic patients and associated EHRs (Walonoski et al. ). Synthea TM is an open-source software package that simulates the lifespans of synthetic patients using realistic models of disease progression and corresponding standards of care. These models rely on a diverse set of real-world data sources, including the United States Census Bureau demographics, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) prevalence and incidence rates, and National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports. The Synthea TM package was developed by an international research collaboration involving the MITRE Corporation and the HIKER Group, and is in turn based on the Publicly Available Data Approach to the Realistic Synthetic EHR framework (Dube and Gallagher). We customized the Synthea TM synthetic data generation workflow to produce the following 18 data tables (see also the Synthea TM data dictionary ):\n\nTable Description Allergies Patient allergy data. CarePlans Patient care plan data, including goals. Claims Patient claim data. ClaimsTransactions Transactions per line item per claim. Conditions Patient conditions or diagnoses. Devices Patient-affixed permanent and semi-permanent devices. Encounters Patient encounter data. ImagingStudies Patient imaging metadata. Immunizations Patient immunization data. Medications Patient medication data. Observations Patient observations including vital signs and lab reports. Organizations Provider organizations including hospitals. Patients Patient demographic data. PayerTransitions Payer transition data ( i.e. , changes in health insurance). Payers Payer organization data. Procedures Patient procedure data including surgeries. Providers Clinicians that provide patient care. Supplies Supplies used in the provision of care.\n\nTo simulate an EHR system, we pre-processed all synthetic data (see code/construct_database.Rmd ) and standardized all fields. Next, we constructed a PostgreSQL database and keyed relevant tables together using primary and foreign keys constructed by hand. In total, our database contains 199,717 records from 20 patients across 262 different fields . However, it is important to note that our data generation pipeline is scalable to tens of thousands of patients (and we have tested this synthetic data generation capacity).\n\nFinally, we coupled the PostgreSQL database with the RedwoodJS full stack web development framework to build a web application that allows:\n\nPhysicians: Physicians to access the clinical summaries and questions generated by Amanuensis for each of their patients. Patients: Patients to access the questions generated by Amanuensis and respond to them via a web form.\n\nTo generate both clinical summaries and questions for each patient, we used the OpenAI GPT-3 API . In both cases, GPT-3 was prompted with a subset of the EHR record for a given patient inserted into a prompt template for GPT-readability. Other key features of our web application include:\n\nAuthentication: Users can log in with their email addresses; physicians are automatically redirected to their dashboard upon login, while patients are redirected to a page where they can respond to the questions generated by Amanuensis. EHR Access: Physicians can also access the full synthetic EHR for each patient as well as view autogenerated graphs and data visualizations, which they can use to review the accuracy of the clinical summaries and questions generated by Amanuensis. Patient Response Collection: Prior to an appointment, Amanuensis will automatically collect the patient's responses to the NLP-generated questions and send them to the physician. During an appointment, physicians will be informed by these responses which will facilitate better clinical decision-making."},{"heading":"Future Directions 🚀","content":"In the future, we hope to integrate Amanuensis into existing EHR systems ( e.g. , Epic, Cerner, etc.), providing physicians with a seamless, AI-powered assistant to help them make more informed clinical decisions. We also plan to enrich our NLP pipeline with real patient data rather than synthetic EHR records. In concert with gold-standard annotations generated by physicians, we intend to fine-tune our question generation and clinical summarization models on real-world data to improve the sophistication and fidelity of the generated text and enable more robust clinical reasoning capabilities.\n\nDevelopment Team 🧑‍💻\n\nAyush Noori Iñaki Arango Addea Gupta Smriti Somasundaram\n\nThis project was completed during the TreeHacks 2023 hackathon at Stanford University.\n\nAward Descriptions 🏆\n\nBelow, we provide descriptions of specific prizes at TreeHacks 2023 which we believe Amanuensis is a strong candidate for. Please note that this list is non-exhaustive. We thank the sponsors and judges for their consideration.\n\nPatient Safety Technology Challenge\n\nBy guiding physicians to make more informed clinical decisions, Amanuensis will help reduce medical errors and improve patient safety. We anticipate that Amanuensis is well poised to avert patient harm and reduce the indidence of medical across the continuum of care, including:\n\nMedication errors: Through AI-based summarization of the medication history and identification of key risk factors for adverse drug events, potential drug-drug interactions, drug-allergy reactions, and drug-disease contraindications, Amanuensis will help physicians prescribe safer medications. Procedural/surgical errors: With access to patient responses to relevant AI-generated questions, physicians will be more prepared for procedures and surgeries, and will be able to identify potential complications and risks. Diagnostic errors: By providing physicians with a summary of the patient's medical history, relevant clinical findings, and most salient symptoms, Amanuensis will help physicians make more accurate diagnoses and avoid treatment errors.\n\nWe thank Dr. Paul Tang for his time and guidance throughout the hackathon.\n\nBest Startup and Most Likely to Become a Business\n\nThe EHR industry is ripe for disruption. Among hospitals with over 500 beds, the two dominant EHR systems, Epic and Cerner, hold 85% market share: Epic’s market share is 58%, and Cerner’s market share is 27%. Yet, physicians consistently express frustration with antiquated and inefficient interface. By contrast, Amanuensis offers a unique value proposition to physicians: a seamless, AI-powered assistant that may integrate with or supplant existing EHR systems. We believe that Amanuensis will be well positioned to disrupt the EHR industry and become a leading provider of AI-powered clinical decision support tools.\n\nBest Use of Data\n\nAmanuensis is undergirded by careful and nuanced analysis of large electronic medical datasets. To construct and validate Amanuensis, we generated a dataset with 199,717 records from 20 patients across 262 different fields; further, our synthetic EHR data generation pipeline can scale to tens of thousands of patients. Our deep understanding of the data enabled us to construct a large relational database with explicit foreign and primary keys; we later exploit these relations to efficiently query the database in JavaScript. Finally, informed by our high-quality dataset, we used leading large language models like GPT-3 from OpenAI to generate clinical summaries and questions for each patient, and designed a user interface for clinicians to both access and validate this information.\n\nBest Hack for a Real World Use Case\n\nWe carefully designed our solution to address a real-world problem: the need for more efficient and effective clinical decision support tools. Further, we iterated on our solution throughout the hackathon, incorporating feedback from physicians such as Dr. Paul Tang and other stakeholders to ensure that our solution is both feasible, impactful, and closely aligned with physician needs.\n\nMost Ethically Engaged Hack\n\nPatient privacy and safety are at the core of our hack. Thus, we invested significant effort in generating synthetic data records, which we provided to downstream language models in our web application. We also designed our web application to leave the database unexposed, and we plan to integrate Amanuensis into existing EHR systems to ensure that patient data is stored securely and is only accessible to authorized users."},{"heading":"References 📚","content":"Noori, A. et al.

As usage of the platform grows and becomes a more prominent source of news and media consumption in the future, tools such as Semantic Search are required to help parse this information.\n\nBecause all data is stored on-chain, the contracts are optimized to minimize storage. Thus, although a user may have made hundreds of posts over time, only a single post is stored in the smart contract state at any given time. When a new post is made, the old post is deleted to free storage and the new post replaces it. Thus, recreating the entire chain of user posts requires traversing the blockchain history to analyze each block and fetch the current post for the user at that block. Building an indexer would be the best solution for this problem, but due to resource & time constraints, we opt for a different solution.\n\nA user inputs a Near Social account id along with a semantic search query. We use the Pagoda Enchanced API to then grab all the blocks that the account ID of interest has had any interaction in. We then query the SocialDB Contract (which contains all the state of Near Social) to reconstruct the chain of posts the user has made.\n\nThese posts are then passed into our backend server, which is written in python & uses FastAPI as the web framework. With the posts in hand, we use NLTK to slice up the text into smaller chunks composed of complete sentences. This will allow us to identify the most relevant chunks of text. We calculate the word embeddings for each of our chunks – the embeddings come from OpenAI's Embedding Model . With embeddings in hand, we compute a similarity search using Facebook Research's FAISS library against the user-inputted semantic search query. In order to capture surrounding context, we also retrieve neighboring textual chunks (the +/- 1 chunks that surround the relevant chunks we have found). We then return these results to the user.\n\nFor deployment, we deploy a docker container on AWS ECS using Fargate as our compute engine to autoscale compute resources depending on website load. Our container fleet sits behind an Elastic Load Balancer that provides SSL termination."},{"heading":"Build","content":"Backend\n\nFor our backend code we use a Makefile for our build process and Poetry as our dependency manager for Python. Install poetry, change directories into the server folder, and then run poetry install to install all dependencies. Note that we require python 3.9.13 and that the Rust Compiler must be installed on your machine in order to build certain dependencies. An OpenAI API Key is required for the project, and must be available in the environment as OPENAI_API_KEY . You can run export OPENAI_API_KEY=<your key> in your current shell or add the key to your .zshenv file.\n\nAfterwards, run make setup to configure your environment to run our application. To run the server run make server . To build a docker image for the server run make docker-build-local . To create a docker container based on the image run make docker-run-local .\n\nFrontend\n\nOur frontend is built using React , Next.js , and Tailwind CSS .

Needing native gas to process transactions on a new chain is a nightmare to acquire and necessitates a centralized exchange that the user can interact with (with all the pain points of CEXs like KYC and delays). We’ve figured out a way to use Zetachain’s cross-chain swaps to be able to send gas to any chain as long as you have some tokens on one chain. This way, users don’t have to route through CEX and acquire gas without touching a custodial actor."},{"heading":"If we had more time","content":"One of the best ways to improve our product would be to incorporate fiat onramps so users don’t have to have any existing tokens on any chain to split gas across chains.

This feature would make our product fully abstracted for the Web3 newbie, allowing them to start with gas on any chain they wanted using the fiat money they already possess."},{"heading":"How we built our project","content":"On the backend, we implemented a Solidity smart contract that conducted cross-chain swaps. This contract would first take the native token on the first chain and use the Uniswap quoter and router to swap it into ZETA tokens on the first chain. Then, we would use Zetachain’s cross chain messaging Connector API to send the ZETA tokens to a second chain. On receiving these tokens on the second chain, the smart contract would deconstruct the message, then use the Uniswap quoter and router again to swap the ZETA tokens back into the desired native token on the second chain. On the frontend, we used a combination of Webflow and React. We used Webflow to make a landing page that described many of the features of our project as well as a sample user flow. For the actual smart contract interaction, we linked the Webflow landing page to a React page that uses web3.js to interact with the smart contracts. Setting up the smart contracts was quite involved. First, we had to deploy this contract onto every single chain that we wanted to potentially swap tokens into. Then, we had to call the setInteractorByChainId function so that each contract would know where its counterparts on other chains lived. After all of this was set up, swaps were ready to be made by the user."},{"heading":"Challenges we faced","content":"This was the first time any of us had dealt with programming on the blockchain across chains.

But now, in a world where counterfeits are so hard to spot and brand value reigns supreme, the single most important question has become “is it real?” As unfortunate as it is, with the explosion of e-commerce, counterfeits have become an increasingly prominent concern in the purchase of any item, from consumer electronics to even fields as critical as prescription medication. However, no sector of business has been hit harder by counterfeiting than that of luxury apparel and accessories.\n\nThe rise of counterfeiting has spawned a $118 billion anti-counterfeiting industry, with advanced QR codes and printing techniques employed to make it more difficult for bad actors to manufacture fakes and third-party validation companies like StockX protecting the resale market from fakes. Ironically, anti-counterfeiting measures have inspired many counterfeiters to also manufacture fake anti-counterfeiting features, including copied QR codes, forged certificates of authenticity, and even fake StockX tags. As a result it is absolutely impossible to say with 100% certainty that anything sold by anybody but the manufacturer itself is real, a plight that has plagued the secondhand market for years.\n\nIn a survey of several sneakerheads across the nation with varying stakes in the sneaker resale market, the unanimous single largest concern when buying goods, even with seemingly proper documentation, is that the product is counterfeit, and the process of verifying/proving authenticity takes an average of nearly half the time spent on a transaction (over ten minutes!).\n\nWe seek to provide a solution to this problem by leveraging the immutability of the blockchain, transparent transaction history of digital assets, and the unforgeability of digital signatures to INSTANTLY certify with 100% certainty that a physical asset is real using an NFT."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Apto-check is a protocol built on the Aptos blockchain that backs verifiably legitimate physical assets with NFTs. The protocol works as such:\n\nWhen the admin receives the asset’s serial number and substantial evidence that an asset is legitimate (what qualifies as “substantial” is either proof of recent purchase directly from the manufacturer or verification by trusted third parties like StockX or GOAT), the admin mints an NFT for the asset using the admin account’s private key and sends it to the address of the user requesting the NFT. It is important to note that the protocol is structured such that new NFTs can only be minted by ONE ADDRESS, the admin account. This is done deliberately, as it allows for every NFT minted for Apto-check to be traced back to the exact same minting address, making Apto-check NFTs absolutely impossible to counterfeit. Even if a criminal were able to mint an NFT with the exact same picture, serial number, and internal smart contract data, because they don’t have the admin’s private key, the fake NFT would trace back to the criminal’s address, rather than the admin’s, making it painfully obvious that the NFT is fake. Although this is certainly enough to invalidate attempts to counterfeit Apto-check NFTs, Apto-check actually has an additional safeguard in place in that it is impossible to send, receive, or even view NFTs not minted by the admin address, meaning that even if a counterfeit Apto-check NFT were to make it into an Aptos wallet, it would be impossible to use in the Apto-check dApp.\n\nApto-check syncs with a user’s Petra Aptos wallet, and shows a detailed overview of the user’s current Apto-check NFTs on the homepage. Because Apto-check is meant to be used as a tool for the sneaker resale industry, let us consider how the dApp performs in the case of a sneaker sale. The idea is that a sale between buyer Alice and seller Bob will go as follows:\n\nAlice takes a look at an Apto-check backed pair of Jordans and decides that she is interested in purchasing it. Alice asks the ultimate question in requesting proof that those Jordans are real. Bob shows Alice the corresponding Apto-check NFT on the homepage of the Apto-check dApp, and demonstrates that the NFT’s serial number field matches the physical serial number on the pair of Jordans. Alice is assured without any doubt that the pair of Jordans are real, and decides to buy the shoes. Bob transfers the corresponding NFT to Alice’s Aptos address through the Apto-check dApp. Upon receiving the pending transfer of the shoes’ NFT in her Aptos wallet, Alice pays Bob for the shoes and accepts the transaction. The NFT is transferred to her wallet, and Alice is now able to prove to anybody that her Jordans are undeniably real.\n\nThe hope is that in the sneaker resale market, Apto-check NFTs will be used as an undeniable standard of authenticity."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Frontend: React, Typescript, Tailwind, Next.js Backend: Typescript + Aptos API, Firebase Blockchain: Aptos Accounts DB: Firestore Aptos Wallet: Petra Design: GIMP & MS Paint"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Learning how to use the Aptos API to interact with the Aptos blockchain was difficult to pick up, as it was both of our first times ever being exposed to the Aptos blockchain.

In addition, we’re very happy with the user-friendly user experience we’ve created, as we believe that especially with blockchain projects, it is of utmost importance to make it easy enough for a user with no blockchain background at all to use properly."},{"heading":"Features Coming Soon to Apto-Check","content":"Our intentions from the start were to subsidize all gas fees as to prevent overcomplicating the user experience by requiring all users to have APT in their wallets.

We plan to allow users to sign up and sign in with just their email addresses and passwords by setting up wallets for them when they sign up to remove the overcomplication of needing to deal with multiple platforms."},{"heading":"Apto-Check’s growth strategy","content":"Apto-Check has been segmented for the sneakerhead market first for several reasons, with the most obvious being the importance of proving genuinity quickly and with complete certainty, and with the most important being that the sneakerhead community has a generally bullish outlook on NFTs and has a substantial amount of overlap with the NFT community. We hope to establish Apto-Check as the new golden standard for authenticity in the sneakerhead market, just like how StockX did with their verification tags before they started getting faked, and use this to expand into the very adjacent broader market for luxury apparel.\n\nGiven Apto-check’s potential to disrupt the $1.7 - 4.5 trillion market for counterfeit goods, the market potential for Apto-check, especially if it becomes integrated in the luxury goods supply chain (e.g. partnering with manufacturers to mint NFTs for all goods produced), is incredible. Furthermore, because it costs fractions of a penny for each transaction, monetization via charging a flat fee for each NFT minted will be infinitely scalable due to the negligible cost of maintaining the Apto-check network."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"aptos firebase firestore gimp next.js next.js-backend:-typescript-+-aptos-api petra react tailwind typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Saga","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/saga-7fivyd","tagline":"Custom, user driven bedtime stories for children using generative AI -- Saga makes reading more fun and educational","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/391/957/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2023","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Chat App by You.com: $2000"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"flutter","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flutter"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"openai","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"www.sagaverse.app","url":"http://www.sagaverse.app"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/davisgcii/codeontap"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"There are few better feelings in the world than reading together with a child that you care about. “Just one more story!” — “I promise I’ll go to bed after the next one” — or even simply “Zzzzzzz” — these moments forge lasting memories and provide important educational development during bedtime routines.

We eventually became more familiar with the structure of quality prompts, but we hit our heads against this particular problem for a long time. Illustration generation - We weren’t able to predictably write OpenAI illustration prompts that provided consistently quality images. This was a particularly difficult problem for us since we had planned on having a consistent character illustration throughout the story.

With this in mind, we built several layers of passive and active protection to ensure all content is family friendly."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"So many things about OpenAI!\n\nCreating consistent images using OpenAI generation is super hard, especially when focusing on one primary protagonist. We addressed this by specifically using art styles to decrease the variability between images. GPT-3's input / output length limitations are much more stringent than ChatGPT's -- this meant we had to be pretty innovative with how we maintained the context over the course of 10+ page stories. How to reduce overall response time while using OpenAI's API, which was really important when generating so many images and using GPT-3 to describe and summarize so many things. Simply instructing GPT to not do something doesn’t seem to work as well as carefully crafting a prompt of behavior you would like it to model.

We custom laser cut the payload “claw” out of acrylic and connected an Arduino Nano to the drone to control the claw’s I/O and mechanism. We discovered the ANAFI drone runs linux and can give and receive serial commands. Because we can control external peripherals (microcontrollers, etc), we created a small peripheral device out of a microcontroller, LEDs, buttons, and servo motor controller on a custom proto board to use in a mechanical assembly later.\n\nMechanical assembly: due to tight time constraints (3D printing is too slow), we were only left with laser cutting which led to design challenges (constrained to 2D objects). With this, we used compliant mechanisms to retrofit onto the drone’s curvature and body, accommodating numerous constraints (space, weight, air flow, staying clear of propellers, reliability, diverse set of payloads). We also wrote small calibration software to make sure motors go into correct positions and firmware to communicate with drone.\n\nSoftware: We built our frontend using React/Typescript and Ant Design. We set up a Node JS server on the backend to handle local API requests. We used custom prompt schemes in ChatGPT from OpenAI to extract the relevant information from the medical record for prescription/lab test delivery.\n\nWe send a POST request from our frontend to our primary endpoint ‘/upload’ to process the medical record. We had a custom prompt sequence that included setting initial context, querying the name, prescriptions/lab tests, and addresses to extract across a general set of medical records. We then sent the extracted and formatted data to our Node server to re-surface back to the client for a drone operator to program the drone’s autonomous flight and know which prescription/lab tests to include in the payload."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Due to safety constraints with regards to flying drones outside of Treehacks' drone cage, we were not able to show a test flight of sending the drone to a patient's home. Therefore, we decided to split the project into two halves:\n\nCreate a provider portal to upload a medical record, then use NLP to extract relevant patient, prescription, and delivery information from the medical record to surface to a drone operator. Build a native drone attachment to carry the medical prescription/lab test and directly integrate with the drone's firmware to drop the test at a specified time (e.g., when the drone reaches the patient's home).\n\nWe also ran into several rate limit and inconsistent response challenges with ChatGPT. To resolve the rate limit issues, we added an error checking mechanism to flag if we need to re-log in to ChatGPT or start a VPN. To improve response accuracy, we created a custom function to check for valid answers (e.g., delivery address should start with an integer).\n\nHardware is always hard, but especially more difficult with drones, including:\n\nANAFI simulator package hardware dependent on having an NVIDIA graphics card which no one on our team had. Building hardware (design, fabrication, assembly) in this small of a time frame is difficult (ie. resort to laser cutting).

Because Flask is a Python library, we use Supabase's community managed Python library to insert and update data."},{"heading":"Checkbook.io","content":"We use Checkbook.io's Payfac API to create transactions between shoppers and vendors. When people create an account on Locl, they are automatically added as a user in Checkbook with the POST /v3/user endpoint. Meanwhile, to onboard both local farmers and shoppers painlessly, we offer a bankless solution with Checkbook’s virtual credit card using the POST /v3/account/vcc endpoint.\n\nFirst, shoppers deposit credits into their Locl account from the EBT card. The EBT funds are later redeemed with the state government by Locl. Whenever a user buys an item, we use the POST /v3/check/digital endpoint to create a transaction between them and the stores to pay for the goods. From there, vendors can also spend their funds as if it were a prepaid debit card. By using Checkbook’s API, we’re able to break down the financial barrier of having a bank account for low-income shoppers to buy fresh produce from local suppliers, when they otherwise wouldn’t have been able to.\n\nChallenges we encountered\n\nBecause we were all new to using these APIs, we were initially unclear about what actions they could support. For example, we wanted to use You.com API to build our marketplace. However, it soon became apparent that we couldn't embed their API into our static HTML page as we'd assume. Thus, we had to pivot to creating our own cards with Jinja.\n\nLooking forward\n\nIn the future, we hope to advance our API services to provide a wider breadth of services which would include more than just produce from local farmers markets. Given a longer timeframe, a few features we'd like to implement include:\n\na search and filtering system to show shoppers their preferred goods. an automated redemption system with the state government for EBT. improved security and encryption for all API calls and database queries.\n\nEthics\n\nSNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program), otherwise known as food stamps, is a government program that aids low-income families and individuals to purchase food. The inaccessibility of healthy foods is a pressing problem because there is a small number of grocery stores that accept food stamps, which are often limited to large, chain grocery stores that are not always accessible. Beyond this, these grocery stores often lack healthy food options in favor of highly-processed goods.\n\nWhen doing further research into this issue, we were fortunate to have a team member who has knowledge about SNAP benefits through firsthand experience in classroom settings and at food banks. Through this, we learned about EBT (Electronic Benefit Transfer) cards, as well as their limitations. The only stores that can support EBT payments must offer a selection for each of the staple food categories, which prevents local markets and farmers from accepting food stamps as payment.\n\nTo tackle this issue of the limited accessibility of healthy foods for SNAP benefit users, we came up with Locl, an online platform that allows local markets and farmers to list fresh produce for EBT cardholders to purchase with food stamps. When creating Locl, we adhered to our goal of connecting food stamp users with healthy, ethically sourced foods in a sustainable manner. However, there are still many ethical challenges that must be explored further.\n\nFirst, to use Locl, users would require a portable electronic device and an internet connection due to it being an online platform. The Pew Research center states that 29% of adults with incomes below $30,000/year do not have access to a smartphone and 44% do not have portable internet access. This would greatly lessen the range of individuals that we aim to serve.\n\nSecond, though Locl aims to serve SNAP beneficiaries, we also hope to aid local markets and farmers by increasing the number of potential customers. However, Locl runs the risk of displaying certain produce items or marketplaces disproportionately in comparison to others, which could create imbalances and inequities between all stakeholders involved. Furthermore, this display imbalance could limit user knowledge about certain marketplaces.\n\nThird, Locl aims to increase ethical consumerism by connecting its users with sustainable markets and farmers. However, there arises the issue of selecting which markets and farmers to support on our platform. While considering baselines that we would expect marketplaces to meet to be displayed on Locl, we recognized that sustainability can be measured through a wide number of factors- labor, resources used, pollution levels, and began wondering whether we prioritize sustainability of items we market or the health of users. One example of this is meat, a popular food product which is known for its high health benefits, but similarly high water consumption and greenhouse gas levels. Narrowing these down could greatly limit the display of certain products.\n\nFourth, Locl does not have an option for users to filter the results that are displayed to them. Many EBT cardholders say that they do not use their benefits to make online purchases due to the difficulty of finding items on online store pages that qualify for their benefits as well as their dietary needs. Thus, our lack of a filter option would cause certain users to have increased difficulty in finding food options for themselves.\n\nOur next step for Locl is to address the ethical concerns above, as well as explore ways to make it more accessible and well-known. However, there are still many components to consider from a sociotechnical lens. Currently, only 4% of SNAP beneficiaries make online purchases with their EBT cards. This small percentage may stem from reasons that range from lack of internet access, to not being aware that online options are available. We hope that with Locl, food stamp users will have increased access to healthy food options and local markets and farmers will have an increased customer-base.\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/full/10.2105/AJPH.2019.305325 https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6546-2 https://www.ibisworld.com/industry-statistics/number-of-businesses/supermarkets-grocery-stores-united-states/ https://www.masslive.com/food/2022/01/these-are-the-top-10-unhealthiest-grocery-items-you-can-buy-in-the-united-states-according-to-moneywise.html https://farmersmarketcoalition.org/education/qanda/ https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-019-6546-2 https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2019/08/09/farmers-market-week-2019/"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"checkbook flask jinja python supabase"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"First Plate","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/first-plate","tagline":"Choose a plate, go on a date!

This helped everyone involved get on the same page and create a shared vision for the project. After that, we moved on to creating a Figma mockup, where we made visual prototypes of the app's user interface. This is a critical step in the development process as it allows the team to get a clear idea of how the app will look and feel. Once the mockup was completed, we commenced the React Native implementation. This step can be quite involved and requires careful planning and attention to detail. Finally, once we completed the app, we moved on to debugging and making final touches.

Beyond the frontend design, we learned how to create a login and sign-up page, securely connected to the Supabase backend, and integrated the Checkbook API for the \"pay it forward\" feature. Both of these features were also new to our team. Along the way, we encountered many React Native bugs, which were challenging and time-consuming to debug as a beginner team.

As previous Swift users, we had to learn the basics of this language, including how to use the terminal and Expo to write code efficiently and effectively.\n\nIn addition to learning how to code in React Native, we also gained valuable experience in backend development using Supabase, a platform that provides a range of powerful tools and features for building, scaling, and managing app infrastructure. We learned how to use Supabase to create a real-time database, manage authentication and authorization, and integrate with other popular services like Stripe, Slack, and GitHub.\n\nFinally, we used the Checkbook API to allow the user to create digital payments and send digital checks within the app using only another user's name, email, and the amount the user wants to send.

Whether its classes, projects, financials, research, personal hobbies -- there are many different, yet predictable, ways in which we open an endless amount of tabs for fear of forgetting a chunk of information that may someday be relevant.\n\nOrigin aims to revolutionize your personal browsing experience -- one workspace at a time."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"In a nutshell, Origin uses state-of-the-art natural language processing to identify personalized, smart workspaces . Each workspace is centered around a topic comprised of related tabs from your browsing history, and Origin provides your most recently visited tabs pertaining to that workspace and related future ones, a generated textual summary of those websites from all their text, and a fine-tuned ChatBot trained on data about that topic and ready to answer specific user questions with citations and maintaining history of a conversation. The ChatBot not only answers general factual questions (given its a foundation model), but also answers/recalls specific facts found in the URLs/files that the user visits (e.g. linking to a course syllabus).\n\nOrigin also provides a semantic search on resources, as well as monitors what URLs other people in an organization visit and recommend pertinent ones to the user via a recommendation system .\n\nFor example, a college student taking a History class and performing ML research on the side would have sets of tabs that would be related to both topics individually. Through its clustering algorithms, Origin would identify the workspaces of \"European History\" and \"Computer Vision\", with a dynamic view of pertinent URLs and widgets like semantic search and a chatbot. Upon continuing to browse in either workspace, the workspace itself is dynamically updated to reflect the most recently visited sites and data.\n\nTarget Audience : Students to significantly improve the education experience and industry workers to improve productivity."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Languages : Python ∙ JavaScript ∙ HTML ∙ CSS\n\nFrameworks and Tools : Firebase ∙ React.js ∙ Flask ∙ LangChain ∙ OpenAI ∙ HuggingFace\n\nThere are a couple of different key engineering modules that this project can be broken down into.\n\n1(a). Ingesting Browser Information and Computing Embeddings\n\nWe begin by developing a Chrome Extension that automatically scrapes browsing data in a periodic manner (every 3 days) using the Chrome Developer API. From the information we glean, we extract titles of webpages. Then, the webpage titles are passed into a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) from Huggingface, from which latent embeddings are generated and persisted through a Firebase database.\n\n1(b). Topical Clustering Algorithms and Automatic Cluster Name Inference\n\nGiven the URL embeddings, we run K-Means Clustering to identify key topical/activity-related clusters in browsing data and the associated URLs.\n\nWe automatically find a description for each cluster by prompt engineering an OpenAI LLM, specifically by providing it the titles of all webpages in the cluster and requesting it to output a simple title describing that cluster (e.g. \"Algorithms Course\" or \"Machine Learning Research\").\n\n2. Web/Knowledge Scraping\n\nAfter pulling the user's URLs from the database, we asynchronously scrape through the text on each webpage via Beautiful Soup. This text provides richer context for each page beyond the title and is temporarily cached for use in later algorithms.\n\n3. Text Summarization\n\nWe split the incoming text of all the web pages using a CharacterTextSplitter to create smaller documents, and then attempt a summarization in a map reduce fashion over these smaller documents using a LangChain summarization chain that increases the ability to maintain broader context while parallelizing workload.\n\n4. Fine Tuning a GPT-3 Based ChatBot\n\nThe infrastructure for this was built on a recently-made popular open-source Python package called LangChain (see https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain ), a package with the intention of making it easier to build more powerful Language Models by connecting them to external knowledge sources.\n\nWe first deal with data ingestion and chunking, before embedding the vectors using OpenAI Embeddings and storing them in a vector store.\n\nTo provide the best chat bot possible, we keep track of a history of a user's conversation and inject it into the chatbot during each user interaction while simultaneously looking up relevant information that can be quickly queries from the vector store. The generated prompt is then put into an OpenAI LLM to interact with the user in a knowledge-aware context.\n\n5. Collaborative Filtering-Based Recommendation\n\nProvided that a user does not turn privacy settings on, our collaborative filtering-based recommendation system recommends URLs that other users in the organization have seen that are related to the user's current workspace.\n\n6. Flask REST API\n\nWe expose all of our LLM capabilities, recommendation system, and other data queries for the frontend through a REST API served by Flask. This provides an easy interface between the external vendors (like LangChain, OpenAI, and HuggingFace), our Firebase database, the browser extension, and our React web app.\n\n7. A Fantastic Frontend\n\nOur frontend is built using the React.js framework. We use axios to interact with our backend server and display the relevant information for each workspace."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had to deal with our K-Means Clustering algorithm outputting changing cluster means over time as new data is ingested, since the URLs that a user visits changes over time. We had to anchor previous data to the new clusters in a smart way and come up with a clever updating algorithm. We had to employ caching of responses from the external LLMs (like OpenAI/LangChain) to operate under the rate limit. This was challenging, as it required revamping our database infrastructure for caching. Enabling the Chrome extension to speak with our backend server was a challenge, as we had to periodically poll the user's browser history and deal with CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors. We worked modularly which was great for parallelization/efficiency, but it slowed us down when integrating things together for e2e testing."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The scope of ways in which we were able to utilize Large Language Models to redefine the antiquated browsing experience and provide knowledge centralization.\n\nThis idea was a byproduct of our own experiences in college and high school -- we found ourselves spending significant amounts of time attempting to organize tab clutter systematically."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project was an incredible learning experience for our team as we took on multiple technically complex challenges to reach our ending solution -- something we all thought that we had a potential to use ourselves."},{"heading":"What's next for Origin","content":"We believe Origin will become even more powerful at scale, since many users/organizations using the product would improve the ChatBot's ability to answer commonly asked questions, and the recommender system would perform better in aiding user's education or productivity experiences."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"firebase flask huggingface pytorch react scikit-learn"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"drive.google.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Theia","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/thiea","tagline":"A simple interfaced supervised model to build and filter Labeled Image Data Sets","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/390/951/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2023","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Startup by YCombinator: Real Interview for Y Combinator (No Expiration) & Dinner on Sunday with YC team"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"ddg","url":null},{"name":"fastai","url":null},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"requests","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/requests"},{"name":"selenium","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/selenium"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/shzcuber/TreeHacks"},{"label":"theia-ten.vercel.app","url":"https://theia-ten.vercel.app/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Every Core Innovation in ML comes from a better architecture, more compute or more and better Data.

The United States was the largest source country for remittances in 2020, followed by the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Switzerland.\n\nHowever, Cross-border payments face 5 main challenges: cost, security, time, liquidity & transparency.\n\nCost: Cross-border payments are typically costly due to costs involved such as currency exchange costs, intermediary charges, and regulatory costs. -Time: most international payments take anything between 2-5 days. -Security: The rate of fraud in cross-border payments is comparatively higher than in domestic payments because it's much more difficult to track once it crosses the border. Standardization: Different countries tend to follow a different set of rules & formats which make cross-border payments even more difficult & complicated at times.

One thing that caught our eye was agriculture – Particularly, livestock production (especially cattle) which is the largest contributor for carbon emissions. Annually, each cow produces 220 pounds of methane and in totality accounts for 14.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture continues to be one of the most important industries that technology overlooks. As a team, we are driven to build in communities and industries that are underserved by existing technologies and from this, GrazePro was born .\n\nWe decided to focus on rotational grazing, a popular farming technique that involves moving livestock between paddocks so that only one or some paddocks are grazed at any given time. On the contrary, continuous grazing involves only one paddock, and the forage is not allowed to fallow. We realized that there was an efficiency maximization problem related to when farmers should switch paddocks to maximize cattle health and ability for grass to regrow. We decided to model this using a simulation."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"GrazePro is a virtual simulation intended to enable farmers to accurately predict and forecast the optimal approach to rotational grazing. This means that we can take real data points provided by farmers, input them into the algorithm that we’ve created and generate actionable suggestions to improve cattle health, sustainable practices and cost efficiency.\n\nOur algorithm can help answer questions such as: How many segments farmers should divide their paddock into? What is the optimal time that cattle should stay within one area to ensure that the grass has time to regrow?\n\nThe prediction algorithm is built on a cellular automata model, which is a collection of cells on a grid that evolves over discrete time steps according to a set of preferences and rules. In this case, we modeled how fast grass grew back based on various factors, including number of cattle, amount of water used, fertilizers used, previous cover crops and more.\n\nUsers have the ability to change certain inputs, such as number of paddocks, number of cows, growth rate of grass and rotation time. When the simulation is played, the dashboard also displays the health of the grass and the cattle and how they change over time according to the feeding patterns of the cattle. Farmers can then use this data to inform their farming practices."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used a combination of coding languages, including Typescript, React, Netlogo.

Whether you're a professional musician or an amateur DJ, Mixingjays can help you create stunning visuals that will take your music to the next level while giving the musicians full creative control over the video."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"One of our baseline innovations is generating video from stable diffusion and engineering on the model internals of stable diffusion. As a standalone, stable diffusion outputs static images based on natural language prompts. Given a list of images that stable diffusion outputs from several prompts, we're able to generate video between the images by interpolating between images in CLIP latent space. A detail of stable diffusion is that it actually computes its output on a latent space, a compressed coordinate system the the model abstractly uses to represent images and text; the latent vector in latent space is then decoded into the image we see. This latent space is well-behaved in Euclidean space, so we can generate new image outputs and smooth transitions between images, strung into a video, by linearly interpolating between the latent vectors of two different images before decoding every interpolated vector. If the two images we interpolate between are from two different prompts from the same seed of stable diffusion, or the same prompt across two different seeds of stable diffusion, the resulting interpolations and video end up being semantically coherent and appealing.[1] A nice augmentation to our interpolation technique is perturbing the latent vector in coordinate space, making a new latent vector anywhere in a small Lp-norm ball surrounding the original vector. (This resembles the setting of adversarial robustness in computer vision research, although our application is not adversarial.) As a result, given a list of stable diffusion images and their underlying latent vectors, we can generate video by latent-space-interpolating between the images in order.\n\nWe generate videos directly from the music, which relies on a suite of algorithms for music analysis. The demucs model from Facebook AI Research (FAIR) performs \"stem separation,\" or isolation of certain individual instruments/elements in a music track; we pass our music track into the model and generate four new music tracks of the same length, containing only the vocals, drums, bass, and melodic/harmonic instruments of the track, respectively. With OpenAI Whisper, we're able to extract all lyrics from the isolated vocal track, as well as bucket lyrics into corresponding timestamps at regular intervals. With more classical music analysis algorithms, we're able to:\n\nconvert our drum track and bass track into timestamps for the rhythm/groove of the track and convert our melody/harmony track into a timestamped chord progression, essentially the formal musical notation of harmonic information in the track.\n\nThese aspects of music analysis directly interface into our stable diffusion and latent-space-interpolation pipeline. In practice, the natural language prompts into stable diffusion usually consist of long lists of keywords specifying:\n\nobjects, textures, themes, backgrounds physical details adjectives influencing tone of the picture photographic specs: lighting, shadows, colors, saturation/intensity, image quality (\"hd\", \"4k\", etc) artistic styles Many of these keywords are exposed to the client at the UI level of our application, as small text inputs, sliders, knobs, dropdown menus, and more. As a result, the client retains many options for influencing the video output, independently of the music. These keywords are concatenated with natural language encapsulations of musical aspects: Lyrics are directly added to the prompts. Melodic/harmonic information and chord progressions map to different colors and themes, based on different chords' \"feel\" in music theory. Rhythm and groove is added to the interpolation system! We speed up, slow down, and alter our trajectory of movement though latent space in time with the rhythm. The result is a high-quality visualizer that incorporates both the user's specifications/edits and the diverse analyzed aspects of the music track.\n\nTheoretically, with good engineering, we'd be able to run our video generation and editing pipelines very fast, essentially in real time! Because interpolation occurs at the very last layer of the stable diffusion model internals, and video output from it depends only on a simple decoder instead of the entire stable diffusion model, video generation from interpolation is very fast and the runtime bottleneck depends only on stable diffusion. We generate one or two dozen videos from stable diffusion per video, so by generating each image in parallel on a wide GPU array, as well as incorporating stable diffusion speedups, we're able to generate the entire video for a music track in a few seconds!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Prompt generation: Generating good quality prompts is hard. We tried different ways of prompting the model to see its affect on the quality of generated images and output video and discovered we needed more description of the song in addition to the manually inputted prompt. This motivated us to look into music analysis.\n\nMusic Analysis: Our music analysis required pulling together a lot of disparate libraries and systems for digital signal processing that aren't typically used together, or popular enough to be highly supported. The challenge here was wrangling these libraries into a single system without the pipeline crumbling to obscure bugs.\n\nStable Diffusion: The main challenge in using stable diffusion for multiple image generation is the overhead cost, compute and time. Primitive implementations of stable diffusion took 30s to generate an image which made things hard for us since we need to generate multiple images against each song and prompt pair. Modal workshop at Treehacks was very helpful for us to navigate this issue. We used modal containers and stubs to bake our functions into the images such that they are run only when the functions are called and free the GPUs otherwise for other functions to run. It also helped us parallelise our code which made things faster. However, since it is new, it was difficult to get it to recognise other files, adding data types to function methods etc.\n\nInterpolation: This was by far the hardest part. Interpolation is not only slow but also hard to implement or reproduce. After extensive research and trials with different libraries, we used Google Research’s Frame-interpolation method. It is implemented in tensorflow, in contrary to the other code which was more PyTorch heavy. In addition to that it is slow and scales exponentially with the number of images. A 1 minute video took 10 minutes to generate. Given the 36 hour time limitation, we had to generate the videos in advance for our app but there is tons of scope to make it faster.\n\nIntegration: The biggest bottlenecks came about when trying to generate visuals for arbitrary input mp3 files. Because of this, we had to reduce our expectation of on-the-fly, real-time rendering of any input file, to a set of input files that we generated offline. Render times ranged anywhere from 20 seconds to many minutes, which means that we’re still a little bit removed from bringing this forward as a real-application for users around the world to toy with. Real-time video editing capabilities also proved difficult to implement given the lack of time for building substantial infrastructure, but we see this as a next step in building out a fully functional product that anyone can use!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We believe we've made significant progress towards a finalized, professional-grade application for our purposes. We showed that the interpolation idea produces video output that is high-quality, semantically coherent, granularly editable, and closely linked to the concurrent musical aspects of rhythm, melody, harmony, and lyrics. This makes our video offerings genuinely usable in professional live performances. Our hackathon result is a more rudimentary proof-of-concept, but our results lead us to believe that continuing this project in a longer-term setting would lead to a robust, fully-featured offering that directly plugs into the creative workflow of hobbyist and professional DJs and other musical live performers."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We found ourselves learning a ton about the challenges of implementing cutting-edge AI/ML techniques in the context of a novel product.

Here are a few of our top priorities:\n\nImproving speed and latency: We're committed to making our app as fast and responsive as possible. That means improving the speed and latency of our image-to-video interpolation process, as well as optimizing other parts of the app for speed and reliability.\n\nVideo editing: We want to give our users more control over their videos. To that end, we're developing an interactive video editing tool that will allow users to regenerate portions of their videos and choose which generation they want to keep. Additionally, we're exploring the use of computer vision to enable users to select, change, and modify objects in their generated videos.\n\nScript-based visualization: We see a lot of potential in using our app to create visualizations based on scripts, particularly for plays and music videos. By providing a script, our app could generate visualizations that offer guidance on stage direction, camera angles, lighting, and other creative elements. This would be a powerful tool for creators looking to visualize their ideas in a quick and efficient manner.\n\nOverall, we're excited to continue developing and refining our app to meet the needs of a wide range of creators and musicians. With our commitment to innovation and our focus on user experience, we're confident that we can create a truly powerful and unique tool for music video creation."},{"heading":"References","content":"Seth Forsgren and Hayk, Martiros, \"Riffusion - Stable diffusion for real-time music generation.\" 2022. https://riffusion.com/about"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"express.js fair firebase github google-cloud huggingface mantine modal next.js node.js numpy openai pytorch react.js render scipy tailwind tensorflow typescript vercel"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Dispatch","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dispatch-wedj2m","tagline":"No Borders.

High transaction fees, lack of alternatives and a lack of transparency all contributed to this problem, leaving families struggling to make ends meet.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, the average cost of sending remittances to low income countries is a striking 7% of the amount sent . For conflict affected families, a 7% transaction fee means the difference between putting food on the table or going hungry for days. The truth is that the livelihoods of those left behind vitally depend on remittance transfers. Remittances are of central importance for restoring stability for families in post-conflict countries. At Dispatch, we are committed to changing the lives of war stricken communities. Our novel app allows families to receive money from their loved ones, without having to worry about the financial barriers that had previously stood in their area.\n\nHowever, the problem is far larger. Economically, over $20 billion has been sent back and forth in the United States this year, and we are barely even two months in. There are more than 89 million migrants in the United States itself.

A report by the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) found that high costs of remittance lead to a loss of $25 billion every year for developing countries . Additionally, they don’t provide clear information on exchange rate and fees, which leads to mistrust among users. Remittance services tend to have an upper limit on how much one can send per transaction, and they end up leading to security issues once money has been sent over. Lastly, these agencies take days to acknowledge, process, and implement a certain transaction, making immediate transfers intractable. Zero alternatives = exploitation : It’s also important to note that very few traditional remittance services are offered in countries affected by war. Remittance services tend not to operate in these regions. With extremely limited options, families are left with no option but to accept the high fees and poor exchange rates by these agencies. This isn’t unique to war stricken countries. This is a huge problem in developing countries. Due to the high fees associated with traditional remittance services, many families in developing countries are unable to fully rely on remittance alone to support themselves. As a result, they may turn to alternative financial options that can be exploitative and dangerous. One such alternative is the use of loan sharks, who offer quick loans with exorbitant interest rates, often trapping borrowers in a cycle of debt."},{"heading":"How we improve the status quo","content":"We are a mobile application that provides a low-cost, transparent and safe way to remit money. With every transaction made through Dispatch, our users are making a tangible difference in the lives of their loved ones.\n\nZERO Transaction fees : Instead of charging a percentage-based commission fee, we charge a subscription fee per month. This has a number of advantages. Foremost, it offers a cost effective solution for families because it remains the same regardless of the transfer amount. This also makes the process transparent and simpler as the total cost of the transaction is clear upfront. Simplifying the process : Due to the complexity of the current remittance process, migrants may find themselves vulnerable to exploitative offers from alternative providers. This is because they don’t understand the details and risks associated with these alternatives. On our app, we provide clear and concise information that guides users through the entire process. A big way of simplifying the process is to provide multilingual support. This not only removes barriers for immigrants, but also allows them to fully understand what’s happening without being taken advantage of.

Through our commitment to innovation, transparency, and customer-centricity, we believe that we can achieve this vision and make a positive impact on the lives of millions of people worldwide."},{"heading":"Ethics","content":"Banks are structurally disincentivized to help make payments seamless for migrants. We read through various research reports, with Global Migration Group’s 2013 Report on the “Exploitation and abuse of international migrants, particularly those in an irregular situation: a human rights approach” to further understand the violation of present ethical constructs. As an example, consider how bad a 3% transaction fees (using any traditional banking service) can be for an Indian student whose parents pay Stanford tuition - 3 % of $ 82, 162 = $ 2464.86 (USD) = 204,005.37 (INR) [1 USD = 82.07 INR] That is, it costs an extra 200,000 Indian rupees for a family that pays Stanford students via a traditional banking service. Consider the fact that, out of 1.4 billion Indians, this is greater than the average annual income for an Indian. Just the transaction fees alone can devastate a home. Clearly, we don’t destroy homes, hearts, or families. We build them, for everyone without exception.\n\nWe considered the current ethical issues that arise with traditional banking or online payment systems. The following ethical issues arise with creating exclusive, expensive, and exploitative payment services for international transfers:\n\nBanks earn significant revenue from remittance payments, and any effort to make the process more seamless could potentially reduce their profits. Banks may view migrant populations as a high-risk group for financial fraud, leading them to prioritize security over convenience in remittance payments Remittance payments are often made to developing countries with less developed financial infrastructure, making it more difficult and costly for banks to facilitate these transactions Many banks are large, bureaucratic organizations that may not be agile enough to implement new technologies or processes that could streamline remittance payments. Banks may be more focused on attracting higher-value customers with more complex financial needs, rather than catering to the needs of lower-income migrants. The regulatory environment surrounding remittance payments can be complex and burdensome, discouraging banks from investing in this area. Banks do not have a strong incentive to compete on price in the remittance market, since many migrants are willing to pay high fees to ensure their money reaches its intended recipient. Banks may not have sufficient data on the needs and preferences of migrant populations, making it difficult for them to design effective remittance products and services. Banks may not see remittance payments as a strategic priority, given that they are only a small part of their overall business. Banks may face cultural and linguistic barriers in effectively communicating with migrant populations, which could make it difficult for them to understand and respond to their needs.\n\nCollectively, as remittances lower, we lose out on the effects of trickle-down economics in developing countries, detrimentally harming how they operate and even stunting their growth in some cases. For the above reasons, our app could not be a traditional online banking system. We feel there is an ethical responsibility to help other countries benefit from remittances. Crucially, we feel there is an ethical responsibility to help socioeconomically marginalized communities help their loved ones. Hence, we wanted to use technology as a means to include, not exclude and built an app that we hope could be versatile and inclusive to the needs of our user. We needed our app design to be helpful towards our user - allowing the user to gain all the necessary information and make bill payments easier to do across the world. We carefully chose product design elements that were not wordy but simple and clear and provided clear action items that indicated what needed to be done. However, we anticipated the following ethical issues arising from our implementation :\n\nData privacy: Remittance payment apps collect a significant amount of personal data from users. It is essential to ensure that the data is used ethically and is adequately protected. Security: Security is paramount in remittance payment apps. Vulnerabilities or data breaches could lead to significant financial losses or even identity theft. Fast transfers can often lead to mismanagement in accounting. Accessibility: Migrants who may be unfamiliar with technology or may not have access to smartphones or internet may be left out of such services. This raises ethical questions around fairness and equity. Transparency: It is important to provide transparent information to users about the costs and fees associated with remittance payment apps, including exchange rates, transfer fees, and any other charges. We even provide currency optimization features, that allows users to leverage low/high exchange rates so that users can save money whenever possible. Inclusivity: Remittance payment apps should be designed to be accessible to all users, regardless of their level of education, language, or ability. This raises ethical questions around inclusivity and fairness. Financial education: Remittance payment apps could provide opportunities for financial education for migrants. It is important to ensure that the app provides the necessary education and resources to enable users to make informed financial decisions.\n\nConscious of these ethical issues, we came up with the following solutions to provide a more principally robust app:\n\nData privacy: We collect minimal user data. The only information we care about is who sends and gets the money. No extra information is ever asked for. For undocumented immigrants this often becomes a concern and they cannot benefit from remittances. The fact that you can store the money within the app itself means that you don’t need to go through the bank's red-tape just to sustain yourself. Security: We only send user data once the user posts a request from the sender. We prevent spam by only allowing contacts to send those requests to you. This prevents the user from sending large amounts of money to the wrong person. We made fast payments only possible in highly urgent queries, allowing for a priority based execution of transactions. Accessibility: Beyond simple button clicks, we don’t require migrants to have a detailed or nuanced knowledge of how these applications work. We simplify the user interface with helpful widgets and useful cautionary warnings so the user gets questions answered even before asking them. Transparency: With live exchange rate updates, simple reminders about what to pay when and to who, we make sure there is no secret we keep. For migrants, the assurance that they aren’t being “cheated” is crucial to build a trusted user base and they deserve to have full and clearly presented information about where their money is going. Inclusivity: We provide multilingual preferences for our users, which means that they always end up with the clearest presentation of their finances and can understand what needs to be done without getting tangled up within complex and unnecessarily complicated “terms and conditions”. Financial education: We provide accessible support resources sponsored by our local partners on how to best get accustomed to a new financial system and understand complex things like insurance and healthcare.\n\nBefore further implementation, we need to robustly test how secure and spam-free our payment system could be. Having a secure payment system is a high ethical priority for us.\n\nOverall, we felt there were a number of huge ethical concerns that we needed to solve as part of our product and design implementation. We felt we were able to mitigate a considerable percentage of these concerns to provide a more inclusive, trustworthy, and accessible product to marginalized communities and immigrants across the world."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api checkbook google-cloud javascript php python retool sql"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"www.canva.com restarauntradar.retool.com shorturl.at"}]},{"project_title":"Pocket Plots","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/pocket-plots","tagline":"Making land ownership accessible and affordable to all","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/386/319/datas/medium.gif","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2023","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Startup by YC, Runner-Ups"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"checkbook","url":null},{"name":"convex","url":null},{"name":"gradio","url":null},{"name":"huggingface","url":null},{"name":"materialui","url":null},{"name":"natural-language-processing","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing"},{"name":"netlify","url":null},{"name":"nltk","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/nltk"},{"name":"numpy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy"},{"name":"pandas","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"scikit-learn","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn"},{"name":"tailwind","url":null},{"name":"transformer","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/crasgaitis/TreeHacks-23-deployment"},{"label":"warm-cendol-1db56b.netlify.app","url":"https://warm-cendol-1db56b.netlify.app/"},{"label":"colab.research.google.com","url":"https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1NH8jJWesyJmiUALU_JdPAiHiSCwNtkne?usp=sharing"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"💡 Inspiration","content":"Generation Z is all about renting - buying land is simply out of our budgets. But the tides are changing: with Pocket Plots, an entirely new generation can unlock the power of land ownership without a budget.\n\nTraditional land ownership goes like this: you find a property, spend weeks negotiating a price, and secure a loan. Then, you have to pay out agents, contractors, utilities, and more. Next, you have to go through legal documents, processing, and more. All while you are shelling out tens to hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nYuck.\n\nPocket Plots handles all of that for you.\n\nWe, as a future LLC, buy up large parcels of land, stacking over 10 acres per purchase. Under the company name, we automatically generate internal contracts that outline a customer's rights to a certain portion of the land, defined by 4 coordinate points on a map.\n\nEach parcel is now divided into individual plots ranging from 1,000 to 10,000 sq ft, and only one person can own a contract to each plot to the plot.\n\nThis is what makes us fundamentally novel: we simulate land ownership without needing to physically create deeds for every person. This skips all the costs and legal details of creating deeds and gives everyone the opportunity to land ownership.\n\nThese contracts are 99 years and infinitely renewable, so when it's time to sell, you'll have buyers flocking to buy from you first.\n\nYou can try out our app here: https://warm-cendol-1db56b.netlify.app/ (AI features are available locally. Please check our Github repo for more.)"},{"heading":"⚙️What it does","content":"Buy land like it's ebay:\n\nWe aren't just a business: we're a platform.

But after FTX and the bitcoin crash, cryptocurrency has been shaken up: blockchain is no longer the future of finance.\n\nInstead, the market is shifting into tangible assets, and at the forefront of this is land. However, land investments have been gatekept by the wealthy, leaving little opportunity for an entire generation\n\nThat's where pocket comes in. By following our novel perpetual-lease model, we sell contracts to tangible buildable plots of land on our properties for pennies on the dollar.\n\nWe buy the land, and you buy the contract.\n\nIt's that simple.\n\nWe take care of everything legal: the deeds, easements, taxes, logistics, and costs. No more expensive real estate agents, commissions, and hefty fees.\n\nWith the power of Pocket, we give you land for just $99, no strings attached.\n\nWith our resell marketplace, you can sell your land the exact same way we sell ours: on our very own website.\n\nWe handle all logistics, from the legal forms to the system data - and give you 100% of the sell value, with no seller fees at all.\n\nWe even will run ads for you, giving your investment free attention.\n\nSo how much return does a Pocket Plot bring?\n\nWell, once a parcel sells out its plots, it's gone - whoever wants to buy land from that parcel has to buy from you.\n\nWe've seen plots sell for 3x the original investment value in under one week. Now how insane is that? The tides are shifting, and Pocket is leading the way.\n\n...powered by artificial intelligence\n\nCaption generation\n\nPocket Plots scrapes data from sites like Landwatch to find plots of land available for purchase. Most land postings lack insightful descriptions of their plots, making it hard for users to find the exact type of land they want. With Pocket Plots , we transformed links into images, into helpful captions.\n\nCaptions → Personalized recommendations\n\nThese captions also inform the user's recommended plots and what parcels they might buy. Along with inputting preferences like desired price range or size of land, the user can submit a text description of what kind of land they want. For example, do they want a flat terrain or a lot of mountains? Do they want to be near a body of water? This description is compared with the generated captions to help pick the user's best match!\n\nChatbot\n\nMinute Land can be confusing. All the legal confusion, the way we work, and how we make land so affordable makes our operations a mystery to many. That is why we developed a supplemental AI chatbot that has learned our system and can answer questions about how we operate.\n\nPocket Plots offers a built-in chatbot service to automate question-answering for clients with questions about how the application works. Powered by openAI, our chat bot reads our community forums and uses previous questions to best help you."},{"heading":"🛠️ How we built it","content":"Our AI focused products (chatbot, caption generation, and recommendation system) run on Python, OpenAI products, and Huggingface transformers.

As an example, we want to showcase two of the team members’ experiences, Mohamed and Rayan’s. Mohamed Musa moved to the US when he was 12, coming from a village in Sudan where he grew up and received his primary education. He did not speak English and struggled until he had an experience with a teacher that transformed his entire learning experience through experiential and interactive learning. From then on, applying those principles, Mohamed was able to pick up English fluently within a few months and reached the top of his class in both science and mathematics. Rayan Ansari had worked with many Syrian refugee students on a catch-up curriculum. One of his students, a 15 year-old named Jamal, had not received schooling since Kindergarten and did not understand arithmetic and the abstractions used to represent it. Intuitively, the only means Rayan felt he could effectively teach Jamal and bridge the connection would be through physical examples that Jamal could envision or interact with. From the diverse experiences of the team members, it was glaringly clear that creating an accessible and flexible interactive learning software would be invaluable in bringing this sort of transformative experience to any student’s work. We were determined to develop a platform that could achieve this goal without having its questions pre-curated or requiring the aid of a teacher, tutor, or parent to help provide this sort of time-intensive education experience to them."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Upon opening the app, the student is presented with a camera view, and can press the snapshot button on the screen to scan a homework problem. Our computer vision model then uses neural network-based text detection to process the scanned question, and passes the extracted text to our NLP model.\n\nOur NLP text processing model runs fully integrated into Swift as a Python script, and extracts from the question a set of characters to create in AR, along with objects and their quantities, that represent the initial problem setup. For example, for the question “Sally has twelve apples and John has three. If Sally gives five of her apples to John, how many apples does John have now?”, our model identifies that two characters should be drawn: Sally and John, and the setup should show them with twelve and three apples, respectively.\n\nThe app then draws this setup using the Apple RealityKit development space, with the characters and objects described in the problem overlayed. The setup is interactive, and the user is able to move the objects around the screen, reassigning them between characters. When the position of the environment reflects the correct answer, the app verifies it, congratulates the student, and moves onto the next question. Additionally, the characters are dynamic and expressive, displaying idle movement and reactions rather than appearing frozen in the AR environment."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our app relies on three main components, each of which we built from the ground up to best tackle the task at hand: a computer vision (CV) component that processes the camera feed into text: an NLP model that extracts and organizes information about the initial problem setup; and an augmented-reality (AR) component that creates an interactive, immersive environment for the student to solve the problem.\n\nWe implemented the computer vision component to perform image-to-text conversion using the Apple’s Vision framework model, trained on a convolutional neural network with hundreds of thousands of data points. We customize user experience with a snapshot button that allows the student to position their in front of a question and press it to capture an image, which is then converted to a string, and passed off to the NLP model.\n\nOur NLP model, which we developed completely from scratch for this app, runs as a Python script, and is integrated into Swift using a version of PythonKit we custom-modified to configure for iOS. It works by first tokenizing and lemmatizing the text using spaCy, and then using numeric terms as pivot points for a prioritized search relying on English grammatical rules to match each numeric term to a character, an object and a verb (action). The model is able to successfully match objects to characters even when they aren’t explicitly specified (e.g. for Sally in “Ralph has four melons, and Sally has six”) and, by using the proximate preceding verb of each numeric term as the basis for an inclusion-exclusion criteria, is also able to successfully account for extraneous information such as statements about characters receiving or giving objects, which shouldn’t be included in the initial setup. Our model also accounts for characters that do not possess any objects to begin with, but who should be drawn in the display environment as they may receive objects as part of the solution to the question. It directly returns filenames that should be executed by the AR code.\n\nOur AR model functions from the moment a homework problem is read. Using Apple’s RealityKit environment, the software determines the plane of the paper in which we will anchor our interactive learning space. The NLP model passes objects of interest which correspond to particular USDZ assets in our library, as well as a vibrant background terrain. In our testing, we used multiple models for hand tracking and gesture classification, including a CoreML model, a custom SDK for gesture classification, a Tensorflow model, and our own gesture processing class paired with Apple’s hand pose detection library. For the purposes of Treehacks, we figured it would be most reasonable to stick with touchscreen manipulation, especially for our demo that utilizes the iPhone device itself without being worn with a separate accessory. We found this to also provide better ease of use when interacting with the environment and to be most accessible, given hardware constraints (we did not have a HoloKit Apple accessory nor the upcoming Apple AR glasses)."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into several challenges while implementing our project, which was somewhat expected given the considerable number of components we had, as well as the novelty of our implementation.\n\nOne of the first challenges we had was a lack of access to wearable hardware, such as HoloKits or HoloLenses. We decided based on this, as well as a desire to make our app as accessible and scalable as possible without requiring the purchase of expensive equipment by the user, to be able to reach as many people who need it as possible.\n\nAnother issue we ran into was with hand gesture classification. Very little work has been done on this in Swift environments, and there was little to no documentation on hand tracking available to us. As a result, we wrote and experimented with several different models, including training our own deep learning model that can identify gestures, but it took a toll on our laptop’s resources. At the end we got it working, but are not using it for our demo as it currently experiences some lag. In the future, we aim to run our own gesture tracking model on the cloud, which we will train on over 24,000 images, in order to provide lag-free hand tracking.\n\nThe final major issue we encountered was the lack of interoperability between Apple’s iOS development environment and other systems, for example with running our NLP code, which requires input from the computer vision model, and has to pass the extracted data on to the AR algorithm. We have been continually working to overcome this challenge, including by modifying the PythonKit package to bundle a Python interpreter alongside the other application assets, so that Python scripts can be successfully run on the end machine. We also used input and output to text files to allow our Python NLP script to more easily interact with the Swift code."},{"heading":"Accomplishments we're proud of","content":"We built our computer vision and NLP models completely from the ground up during the Hackathon, and also developed multiple hand-tracking models on our own, overcoming the lack of documentation for hand detection in Swift.\n\nAdditionally, we’re proud of the novelty of our design. Existing models that provide interactive problem visualization all rely on custom QR codes embedded with the questions that load pre-written environments, or rely on a set of pre-curated models; and Photomath, the only major app that takes a real-time image-to-text approach, lacks support for word problems. In contrast, our app integrates directly with existing math problems, and doesn’t require any additional work on the part of students, teachers or textbook writers in order to function.\n\nAdditionally, by relying only on an iPhone and an optional HoloKit accessory for hand-tracking which is not vital to the application (which at a retail price of $129 is far more scalable than VR sets that typically cost thousands of dollars), we maximize accessibility to our platform not only in the US, but around the world, where it has the potential to complement instructional efforts in developing countries where educational systems lack sufficient resources to provide enough one-on-one support to students. We’re eager to have NazAR make a global impact on improving students’ comfortability and experience with math in coming years."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learnt a lot from building the tracking models, which haven’t really been done for iOS and there’s practically no Swift documentation available for.
