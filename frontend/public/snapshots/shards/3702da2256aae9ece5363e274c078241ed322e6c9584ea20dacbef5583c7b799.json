So, a lot of us end up using Veos or Uber to get around fast, but these are incredibly expensive and even require a startup fee. For example, a simple ride from our residence hall to the memorial union would cost up to 5 dollars. This simply isn’t sustainable for students like ourselves. In general, we can see that transportation around campus is unreliable, time-consuming, and expensive. Villainous scooter rentals can be pricey and cumbersome, and there are thousands of regular bikes sitting idle which could better serve the community when used."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"REMI is a 2 products 1 easy-to-use platform solution that combines a smart bike lock with encrypted NFC keys and an easy‐to‐use mobile app, enabling owners to list their bikes and securely lend them out. Renters simply open the app, find a nearby bike, and unlock it using our NFC technology—no fuss, no hassle. And to safeguard everyone, REMI enforces guaranteed responsibility so bikes are returned safely every time. Bike owners make money by lending out unused bikes, while renters save time and money accessing convenient, affordable transportation. Best of all, the platform is designed to be seamless for both parties."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"On our mobile app development side we utilized Android Studio to code with Flutter and Dart, allowing us to create and support users across multiple platforms. With the help of emulators we were able to test frequently and extensively on Android Pro 9 vanilla devices to make sure the user experience had a natural feel and performed exceptionally. Also, Flutter's wide variety of plugins and libraries helped us make use of Google Maps API, Apple’s modals, geolocators, and more to enable a seamless and user-friendly design that would meet the ever changing needs of Purdue University.\n\nOn the hardware side, REMI made use of the powerful Arduino Nano microcontroller which was equipped with an NFC reader to construct a secure and encrypted smart bike lock system. WIth Bluetooth Low Energy from both central and peripheral peer-to-peer communication we were able to establish strong channels of communication for reliable data transfer. We also utilized I2C communication and PWM servo control to better deliver standards of precision and responsiveness within the hardware. This allowed for our physical and digital components of our platform.\n\nTo help support our back end and database functions, we made sure to use Firebase to ensure that any data from the user and the transactions are handled with state of the art security. With firebase we played close attention to the authentication process and database functions. In the end we made sure to bring together these two dynamic and unique technologies to build a cohesive system that is for students from students within the biking transportation world. By working with these technologies we effectively optimize performance for our campus bike-sharing initiative.\n\nFor our back end, we chose Firebase to manage both authentication and database functions, ensuring that user data and bike-sharing transactions are handled securely and efficiently. This cloud-based solution provides real-time updates and robust data management, making it an ideal choice for a dynamic and scalable platform. By seamlessly integrating these technologies, we have built a cohesive system that enhances user experience, guarantees security, and optimizes performance for our campus bike-sharing initiative."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of our most difficult challenges that we ran into on the technical side was managing the Gradle builds and the stability of the emulators. This would cost us a lot of time and having to also manage the dependencies, build failures, updates, and other things that would go wrong trying to repeatedly rebuild the Gradle which hurt our development progress significantly. Furthermore, the emulator would often crash on us and we had a lot of difficulty recognizing the BLE connections which would also lead to a handful of restarts during the NFC testing portion of the project. To overcome this we just had to make sure that our Gradle was configured optimally, cache the dependencies when we had the chance, and make our debugging approach more efficient to minimize downtime.\n\nAnother major challenge that was difficult to overcome was when we had to integrate the hardware with the software. We had a lot of trouble trying to establish security when it came to a reliable communication method between the NFC bike lock and the mobile app. BLE was also tricky to work around because there were inconsistent and unexpected latency + connection drops while we were working with it. Nevertheless, we pushed through and debugged without fail to fine-tune the system and create a better smart lock mechanism. In the end, these little issues would make all the difference to a difficult user experience compared to a more smooth, user-friendly experience.\n\nOverall, time was a big issue when it came to trying to take on this project. Especially when it came to the more physical component of the project. Just trying to find all the hardware was like a scavenger project, but we eventually worked quickly to go to the Bechtel center, Mechanical Engineering building, and Lamburtus to get access to the parts we needed, spare tools, and 3d-print our product."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As first time Boilermake participants and as freshmen, we are incredibly proud of the incredible progress we were able to make in a very short amount of time, proving to ourselves that with hard work, passion, and a clear vision, anything is possible. Our team did a fantastic job embracing the challenge of using technology unfamiliar to us, and stepped out of our comfort zones to bring our idea to life. Whether it was building the NFC hardware components, or learning how to use flutter to develop mobile apps and the Gradle build process, we ended up building a robust prototype which far surpassed our initial expectations. One of our greatest successes was coordinating our work so that each function could be pieced together and emerge as a functional system. Let’s not overlook the success of not eating our hi-chews we were using for testing!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"As we developed REMI, we came across different ways to push our boundaries and learn together as a team. For example, two of us came into the hackathon with experience using Flutter and Dart, while one teammate had comparatively less exposure to the library. We took this situation and made it a learning opportunity for everyone because we could leverage existing skills we’ve worked with all while coming across recent libraries and dependencies we could implement. Given that this was our very first hackathon where we incorporated a hardware component, it was really interesting to see our NFC reader work alongside BLE technology to communicate with the REMI app we developed. We also got to work extremely closely with the Google Maps API to let users locate and interact with bikes using the API’s geolocation features to handle our backend logic."},{"heading":"What's next for REMI","content":"Envision a world where REMI, a pioneer of community and transportation, provides easier, cheaper, profitable, sustainable transportation to each and every location it reaches. First, REMI would work within university campuses, then expand to larger bike friendly towns and cities, and expand its range of transportation methods(skateboards, hoverboards, roller skates, etc.). REMI would help the community drive sustainable movement, bringing a community together in mutually beneficial relationships. This innovation marks an improvement in increasing the quality of life​ for millions of students, and is truly the superior transportation management system dedicated to students by students."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android-pro-9-vanilla android-studio arduino-nano-micro-controller ble bluetooth bluetooth-low-energy-(peripheral-and-central-peer-to-peer) dart emulators firebase firebase-backend-for-auth-and-database flutter geolocator google-maps i2c-communication java java-sdk nfc-reader pwm-servo-control"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com youtu.be www.canva.com"}]},{"project_title":" MockMade","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/mockmate","tagline":"Perfect your technical and behavioral interview skills with AI.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/003/281/941/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake XII","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-xii.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Place Prize: Sony Headphone"},{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake XII","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-xii.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Cartesia: Best Use of Sonic"},{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake XII","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-xii.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Caterpillar: Best Cloud Implementation"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"auth0","url":null},{"name":"cartesia","url":null},{"name":"cloudinary","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cloudinary"},{"name":"magicui","url":null},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"next.js","url":null},{"name":"openai","url":null},{"name":"react.js","url":null},{"name":"render","url":null},{"name":"retell","url":null},{"name":"sync","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sync"},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"},{"name":"vercel","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"demo.meriedith.com","url":"https://demo.meriedith.com/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/danielxies/bmakebackend"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/danielxies/boilerdemo"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/danielxies/boilerfrontend"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As computer science students ourselves, we experienced the rigorous internship hunt season in this job market.

We hope that this product can be a helpful practice tool that improves job seekers' interview skills."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"MockMade is a mock interview platform that conducts technical and behavioral interviews in real time. Choose a specific company to practice for and choose either a behavioral or technical interview. Our behavioral interview is conducted similar to a phone screen where the user would get a call and an AI would ask questions pertaining to the job. Once the user completes their interview, we process the audio and transcript to grade their interview based on various categories. While it was a phone call interview, you can watch a simulation of your interview in video form between the AI interviewer and your responses. For our technical interview, you would use a leetcode-like platform integrated with AI. While you're coding your solution, ask the interviewer for tips on how to complete the problem and keep you on the right track till you pass all the test cases instead of just searching up the solution."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our behavioral interview uses Retell AI to power the real-time voice and call functionality. The post-interview analysis is conducted using multi-prompt OpenAI calls to grade each category. Our interview video simulation is powered by Sync, where we upload videos to the cloud using Cloudinary and lip sync them to the interview audios. The technical interview involves Whisper to transcribe the input audio, Cartesia Sonic to generate human-like text-to-speech audio, and OpenAI GPT 4o to parse the input transcript and code. We use Auth0 to secure our website with a robust custom log-in and sign-up page. To store the technical interview leetcode questions, we used MongoDB's noSQL database. We hosted our website and product completely on the cloud using Render for the backend and Vercel for the frontend. To build the frontend, we used Next.js, React.js, Typescript, and MagicUI."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had some trouble with Retell AI and making sure that the agent was reliably asking meaningful questions to extensively quiz the interviewee. While we were developing the interview video simulation, we had some trouble getting the latency as low as possible and hosting the videos on the cloud effectively. We spent time working to connect all these technologies to work seamlessly with each other to provide a great experience for the user."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of creating a solution to a problem that every member of this hackathon faces.

The opportunity slips away - not because you aren’t qualified, but because the world cannot hear you.\n\nNow, imagine a world where that barrier doesn’t exist. Where your thoughts and ideas are heard, no matter how you express them. That’s the future we’re building."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"SignBridge is an AI-powered tool that translates American Sign Language (ASL) into both text and speech in real time, breaking down communication barriers for the deaf and non-verbal community.\n\nUsing computer vision , SignBridge captures hand gestures and movements, processes them through a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) , and converts them into readable text. Then, to make interactions more natural, we go a step further— syncing the generated speech with a video of the person signing , making it appear as though they are actually speaking.\n\nThis is achieved using Sync , an AI-powered lip-syncing tool that animates the signer’s lips to match the spoken output. Additionally, SignBridge considers the signer’s gender and race to generate an appropriate AI voice, ensuring a more authentic and personalized communication experience.\n\nWith its ability to provide instant translation and realistic speech synchronization , SignBridge can be used in everyday conversations, workplaces, educational settings, and beyond—helping to create a world where communication is truly inclusive."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"SignBridge: Technical Overview\n\n1) ASL to Speech\n\nOur system leverages a Transformer-based Neural Network to recognize hand gestures made by the user and translate them into spoken language. The model is trained on a dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) gestures and is implemented using MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking and gesture recognition. The trained model processes ASL inputs efficiently, ensuring accurate and seamless translation to speech.\n\n2) User Authentication with Auth0\n\nWe integrate Auth0 for secure user authentication. This is crucial as our system utilizes facial recognition and lip-syncing techniques to enhance the accuracy and personalization of speech generation from ASL gestures. By mapping users' facial movements and lip sync patterns, we create a more natural and context-aware speech output, making interactions more lifelike and engaging.\n\n3) Lip-Sync Audio Generation\n\nTo ensure that the generated speech is synchronized with realistic lip movements, our system makes API calls to specialized lip-syncing services . This feature improves the visual realism and inclusivity of our ASL-to-speech conversion by mapping audio to corresponding lip movements.\n\n4) Generative AI for Word Prediction\n\nA Generative AI model is employed to enhance word prediction and context interpretation. By analyzing sequential ASL inputs, the AI model can predict probable next words, improving the fluency and coherence of the generated speech.\n\n5) Ethnicity and Gender Prediction Using BERT\n\nWe integrate BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to infer the ethnicity and gender of the user based on their name. This information helps tailor the speech synthesis to better match cultural and linguistic nuances, contributing to a more personalized and contextually aware translation.\n\n6) Speech to ASL\n\nThe Speech-to-ASL module follows these steps:\n\nSpeech Collection in the Frontend: The system records speech input from users directly within the web application. Mapping Speech to Hand Motions: To convert speech into ASL gestures, we require a comprehensive dataset of sign language videos that correspond to spoken words. These videos are web-scraped from reliable ASL datasets and repositories, ensuring a diverse and accurate representation of gestures. The processed video segments are then mapped to hand motion sequences and dynamically displayed on the frontend to provide users with an ASL visualization of the spoken input.\n\nBy combining machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision , SignBridge creates an efficient and accessible communication bridge between ASL and spoken language. 🚀"},{"heading":"Challenges We Encountered","content":"Throughout the development of SignBridge , we faced several technical challenges that required iterative problem-solving and optimization. Below is a breakdown of the key issues and how we addressed them:\n\nStep 1: Gesture Recognition Accuracy & Word Buffering\n\nOne of the primary challenges in ASL-to-speech translation was buffer misclassification —when users repeated a gesture, the model sometimes predicted incorrect words due to lingering buffer data. To resolve this, we implemented a buffer filtering mechanism that dynamically removes incorrect predictions and stabilizes the output, ensuring accuracy in translation. Additionally, our dataset was limited to 249 recognized words , and while we had access to a larger dataset, retraining the model on time was impractical. We had to develop an alternative approach to balance dataset limitations with real-time usability.\n\nStep 2: Gender-Neutral Speech Generation\n\nWhen generating speech from ASL, we found that most available text-to-speech (TTS) models defaulted to female voices . To introduce gender diversity in voice synthesis, we designed a mathematical approach to alter pitch and frequency dynamically , allowing us to modify existing voice outputs instead of sourcing additional models.\n\nStep 3: Real-Time Lip-Sync Optimization\n\nSynchronizing generated speech with lip movements was computationally intensive, causing latency issues . We evaluated multiple lip-syncing models to determine the fastest and most efficient approach for real-time performance. Ultimately, we selected an optimized model that significantly reduced sync time , ensuring fluid and natural lip synchronization.\n\nStep 4: Prompt Engineering for Phrase Generation\n\nTo improve ASL-to-text conversion accuracy, we needed to extract the most contextually relevant phrase from multiple predicted words. Using prompt engineering , we refined the model’s ability to select the phrase with the highest contextual weightage from the five most likely word predictions, improving the fluency of translated sentences.\n\nStep 5: Handling Unrecognized Words via Fingerspelling\n\nSince the entire application relied on gesture recognition, there was always a possibility that a word was not present in our dataset . In such cases, we implemented fingerspelling (letter-by-letter spelling of words using ASL hand signs) instead of generating incorrect words, ensuring continued communication."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"One of our biggest accomplishments is creating a tool that has the potential to improve communication and accessibility for people with hearing and speech impairments.

From training a computer vision model to recognize ASL gestures to fine-tuning real-time text and speech output , we tackled complex challenges in deep learning, natural language processing, and synchronization .\n\nBeyond the technology, we’re proud of the impact SignBridge can have . It’s more than just a project—it’s a step toward a more inclusive world where everyone, regardless of how they communicate, has a voice."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"1) Computer Vision Model Implementation with Limited Data\n\nWe learned how to train and optimize computer vision models with a constrained dataset. By leveraging data augmentation and transfer learning , we improved recognition accuracy despite the limited availability of ASL gesture datasets .\n\n2) Real-Time Synchronization Challenges\n\nAchieving real-time synchronization between ASL gestures, speech output, and lip movements was a significant challenge. We optimized our neural network inference speed and reduced latency in video processing to ensure a seamless user experience.\n\n3) Prompt Engineering for Improved Predictions\n\nWe explored prompt engineering techniques to generate contextually accurate phrases from multiple ASL-to-text predictions. This significantly improved the fluency and accuracy of ASL translations , making communication more natural and effective."},{"heading":"What's next for SignBridge","content":"SignBridge is just the beginning of a much larger vision.

Our team was driven by the need to address this growing issue and enhance overall eye health in the digital age. Recognizing that most people aren't aware of the subtle signs of eye strain until it becomes a bigger problem, we developed EyeDentify. Our goal is to create a tool that actively monitors and detects eye strain, empowering users to take proactive steps to maintain eye comfort and well-being during computer use."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"EyeDentify is an eye strain detection web application designed to monitor users' eye movements and detect signs of eye strain or related conditions like redness, watering, or fatigue. By attempting to combine both a trained machine learning model from Roboflow and a blink detection system, EyeDentify analyzes the user’s eye movements and visual patterns, alerting them with popup notifications when it detects strain or discomfort. The application runs seamlessly in the background, sending users real-time notifications, ensuring they take necessary breaks to maintain eye health."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our application is designed to process real-time data from the user’s webcam to detect signs of eye strain. The first step in our process was to gather a large dataset from Kaggle to train a custom model using Roboflow to identify patterns like redness, eye bags, and watery eyes. We were able to develop our model through implementing a workflow that divided the large scale project into smaller steps, making it easier for development. On the other hand, the front end was built with React.js, featuring a live webcam feed that will eventually integrate with our model. User authentication was implemented with Auth0 to ensure privacy to each user. While we weren’t able to fully implement the model into the website during this hackathon, that’s our next step."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Attempting to implement our original idea, a vein detection model, proved quite challenging as we weren't able to acquire enough data to train the model. So, we decided to pivot to another solution to medical issues -- helping reduce eye strain. For this project, one of the biggest challenges we faced was gathering enough data to train our model. We initially struggled to find enough labeled data for Roboflow, which meant we had to change our approach and focus on detecting specific patterns such as redness and bagginess. Another tough part was integrating the model with our React website; we had to figure out how to make the API calls work seamlessly without messing with the rest of the website. However, we learned a lot about how to make things work despite these hurdles!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are really proud of creating a tool that tackles a growing problem—eye strain from too much screen time. By building a model that can track and detect eye strain in real time, we’re giving users a practical, easy-to-use solution.

It helps hackers like ourselves stay informed on when to take breaks especially in hackathons like Boilermake!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Throughout the project, we sharpened our debugging skills to make sure our model performed accurately across all the parameters we set. There were plenty of moments where things didn’t work as expected, but taking the time to troubleshoot and refine our approach helped us push through. We also found that regularly checking in on each other's progress kept us aligned with our goals and made collaboration much more efficient. By working together and staying organized, we were able to tackle challenges more effectively and keep the project moving forward."},{"heading":"What's next for EyeDentify","content":"As we move forward, we plan to combine our blink tracking system with the strain detection model in the future. We’re also focused on improving the model’s accuracy by collecting more diverse data to better capture a wider range of eye strain indicators.
