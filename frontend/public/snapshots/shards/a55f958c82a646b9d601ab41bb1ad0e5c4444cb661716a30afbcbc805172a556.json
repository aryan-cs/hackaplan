These diseases often strike older adults and are characterized by progressive deterioration of nerve cells, eventually leading to cell death. Degenerative nerve diseases can be serious or life-threatening. It depends on the type. Most of them have no cure. Treatments may help improve symptoms, relieve pain, and increase mobility. Early detection of these diseases may help the patient be better prepared for the situation ahead. Certain common symptoms to these disorders are: Resting tremor ( which usually abates during voluntary movement), Very soft and low voice, Impairment of postural balance leading to disturbances in gait and falling, Bradykinesia (slowness and poverty of movement) and others. We use these symptoms and check them through tests involving very basic exercises related to their speech, handwriting, degree of body tremors, etc. The collected data’s analysis may be done using efficient machine learning algorithms (which have proved worthy for such tasks), thereby providing the user a probability of having these disorders. If we can provide pertinent recommendation related to these disorders to someone in his/her earlier stages, they might get saved via appropriate medication. Every life matters and if NeuroDoc can save even a single life, we will consider it a winner."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We, at NeuroDoc, strive to bridge the initial person-doctor interaction by making the patient to take three web-based tests. In test 1, the user is asked to wear a Myo Arm Band whose accelerometer can detect gestures. What we are really interested in, is the amount and degree of tremors (shakes) in a person’s hand while s/he has been asked not to move the hand for about 20-30 seconds. NeuroDoc can detect the amplitude of these tremors through the band and then applies machine learning to classify people with no tremors and the ones with high degree of tremors.\n\nNeuroDoc then moves to Test 2, which involves asking the user to record and upload his latest speech sample. Generally, people with degenerative neurological disorders have stuttered speech and they tend to stammer more often than the other healthy people. NeuroDoc has the ability to classify these patients by detecting and analyzing number of stuttered instances in the speech sample provided by the user. Our implementation uses Fast Fourier Transforms to generate an effective analysis.\n\nIn Test 3, the user is asked to upload a handwriting sample. We chose the user’s signature to be the testing measure for this examination as their new signature sample is easier to match with their signatures on file: forms, bills, etc. Again, Machine Learning comes into picture and here NeuroDoc classifies handwriting samples of people who do not have the disorder against those who have.\n\nAll these tests give some confidence value for the user. It basically generates a probability that the user might be suffering through one of these neurological disorders. NeuroDoc, then, suggests whether the user should immediately contact the doctor or should start/continue treatment by analyzing the generated probabilities."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"Matlab was used for the backend of the main signal processing / pattern recognition. While Matlab was used to develop the algorithms, the open source equivalent, Octave, was used to interface with the web-app. The algorithms themselves use a range of signal processing techniques. For the accelerometer data, a CSV file was read in and parsed using built-in matlab functions. The accelerometers' three axis data was combined using a simple sum of squares approach and subtracting the mean. The output of this was then compared with a threshold. The sum of values larger than the threshold was computed and scaled by the length of the output. This gives a final score for the accelerometer. The handwritten data was processed using a completely different strategy. The image of a signature sample is read in. This image is first rotated by finding the angle that the principal component makes with the horizontal. A rotation matrix is computed and applied to the binarized signature sample. The image is also scaled before comparing it to a dictionary of known good signatures. As long as the image matches at least one of the dictionary images well it will return a high score. The speech data analysis was one of most non-trivial and trickiest problem. The audio file is first divided up into sections of 0.15s. The fast fourier transform (fft) of each of these subsets is computed. The fft of one subsection is compared to all the others. The closer the closest matching fft is to the current subsection, the higher its score. This is also scaled by the length of the segment to make it comparable. HTML, CSS, javascript and python were used to construct the front-end (web-app)."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"The core of our work was development of efficient machine learning techniques. We believe coming up with three independent learning algorithms that handle, speech, text and gesture at a hackathon is quite challenging. This forced us to iterate over our algorithms several times (especially Speech analysis). We had to write several equations and read research papers. Our goal of working for a cause proved challenging, yet satisfying. The secondary issue we faced was lack of a strong front-end developer. So, due to this we spent around 20% of our time creating the simple layouts. But, again this is learning !"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"We developed three novel algorithms for detecting neuro-degenerative diseases, particularly parkinson’s. Each of these algorithms process a different type of data and is able to determine a score to represent the likelihood that the data was collected by someone who is experiencing tremors. These algorithms alongwith the wearable technology they use, can help to solve one of the pre-dominant disease hovering over the human population."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"Probably the most important thing we learned was to reach out to other for help. There are a lot of very talented and knowledgable people here who know the answers to our questions, we need only ask. At the same time, we learned that there were a lot of things that we were capable of solving ourselves by thinking creatively and continuing to pursue the problem. We feel happy that a single hackathon helped us to create innovative algorithms aimed at helping the human population."},{"heading":"What's next for NeuroDoc","content":"Since all of our backgrounds were in Machine Learning and Pattern Recognition, we want to expand NeuroDoc to the next level - Gait detection and Retina Analysis. The problems in machine learning are usually only made tractable with large data sets which we didn’t have for our problem. We would love to extend our project to make use of larger data sets in order to train algorithms which can better solve our problem. In particular, using Long-Short Term Memory networks or Neural Turing Machines to address the speech stuttering problem. The accelerometer data was easily separated but, our next task can be to find the ideal threshold which minimizes error across a range of data sets."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bootstrap javascript machine-learning matlab php python"}]},{"project_title":"Singularity","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/singularity-8qw09c","tagline":"You don't have to know music to write it down~","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/350/038/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackIllinois 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackillinois2016s.devpost.com/","prize_name":"HackIllinois Top Software Hacks"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"cocoapods","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/cocoapods"},{"name":"google","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google--2"},{"name":"latex","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/latex"},{"name":"lilypond","url":null},{"name":"osx","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Ideas matter.

This would allow students to have a live feed for any available study rooms in the buildings of their choice. Something similar is present for EWS stations but those are very limited.

Implementing the POST request was by far the most difficult part of the project because we were not familiar with HTTP requests using Arduino software. We spent 11 hours getting the Edison board to send an HTTP request to our database that would update the occupancy of the respective building/room. Some underlying issues turned out to be stating \"Content-Type: \" of POST request, figuring out the process of Arduino HTTP requests, and debugging the website POST .php file. After we got the HTTP requests to work, moving forward was much easier as the last things to do were to hook up the sensors, code them accordingly and make the refresh button function.

We believe that there is a better, data-driven approach to agricultural business models that results in successful farms, reduced waste and a better market for farmers and consumers (ie: everyone).\n\nIf the market price of a fish increases, the fisherman will aim to get as much fish as possible, even though it results in overfishing. All fishermen would be better off taking less fish as a whole to allow the species to repopulate, giving more profits for everyone the next year. However, this is not the case in real life. Economist Charles Wheelan (author of \"Naked Economics\") described the fishing industry this way, and journalist Michael Pollan (author of \"The Omnivore's Dilemma\") painted a similar picture with the agricultural industry. There is an epidemic of overproduction for crops like corn, leading to selling prices below the cost of production and soil depleted of nutrients.\n\nProviding farmers with simple, intuitive analytics suites and visualizations can aid in the process of planning crops while exposing potentially hidden variables based on market prices, resources, environmental impact, and soil health. This could potentially reduce chemical waste, water usage, and prices on produce, which affects the nutrition and health of all people."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Zoom anywhere on the map in satellite mode until you can see outlines of fields. Click on which crop distribution you would like to see for that view, and the map will be drawn! Each distribution considers profit and resources used, but they are biased towards different factors like water, chemicals, or diversification. The icons correspond to one of twelve sample crops (alfalfa, barley, corn, canola, grass, soy, millet, lentils, edible beans, navy beans, mustard and flax); some farms would have fewer options (eg: corn and soy only) while others may have more."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Data Gathering and Cleaning Our two core datasets came from John Deere's API for field operations and measurements and Climate's API for field GeoJSON data. The John Deere dataset was used to calculate the average water used per unit area per crop, the average amount of chemical used per unit area per crop, and the average yield loss given the initial seed count. Some variables were estimated based on data from the University of Iowa, like the average yield in bushels per 100,000 soybean seeds and other conversion factors. For crop types that lacked statistically significant data, we generated some random points within a reasonable tolerance to fill the gaps for the sake of a more robust visualization. The GeoJSON data was already formatted for the Google Maps API and ready to go.\n\nData Analytics We then constructed a cost-utility mapping algorithm where each crop was assigned to a field. While we aren't agricultural scientists, we made reasonable guesses when constructing our cost function: having higher than expected yields on average gives a negative cost (ie: positive utility) and requiring more chemicals or more water gives a positive cost. These utilities decay (and the costs increase) as more of the same crop type is assigned to a field. This decay can be turned off since many farmers may grow one type at a time; however, it is important for those who want to consider diversification, and second, for the sake of demonstration, it shows how the algorithm groups crops in contiguous regions. With even more, accurate data on market prices and specific field measurements, the algorithm could be even more detailed and precise with its recommendations.\n\nData Visualization Using a Flask framework and our algorithm powering the back-end, we created the web application with the Google Maps API as a tool to draw the CLU (common land units) dataset from Climate from nearly any map view in the United States. The interface is simple, clutter-free, and easy to use."},{"heading":"The Big Picture/Impact","content":"There is power in data analytics and design in the agricultural industry.

Each Flic button has a unique ID which is associated with the table number at which it is located. When the button at a table is pushed, the table ID is placed onto a Service Queue in the order of which the buttons were pressed. The service staff can then view this queue to understand whom to serve first. The Flic button is also used to determine what form of service the user is requesting. One tap of the Flic button sends a request for simple help; two taps sends a request for the check and holding the button removes your table from the queue. Philips Hue smart bulbs were used on this project to reflect the different service requests. The purpose of the bulbs is as a simple visual representation for the service staff."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Flip buttons are connected via Bluetooth to an iPhone, where button commands will send two signals out of each Flic button. One is an HTTP request to our web application's site and the other to the Philips Hue smart bulbs."},{"heading":"What's next for Restaurant Service Queue","content":"We plan to provide capabilities for restaurant owners to customize the table layout that exists in their restaurants.
