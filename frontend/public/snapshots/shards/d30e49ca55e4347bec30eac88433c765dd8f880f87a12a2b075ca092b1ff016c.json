We also empower the user to control their device and reap benefits from their otherwise annoying electricity bill. But most importantly, our water heater will prove essential to saving many regions of the world from unpredictable water and energy crises, pushing humanity to an inevitably greener future.\n\nSome key features we have:\n\n90% energy efficiency An average rate of roughly 10 kW/hr of energy consumption Analysis of real-time and predictive ISO data of California power grids for optimal energy expenditure Clean and easily understood UI for typical household users Incorporation of the Internet of Things for convenience of use and versatility of application Saving, on average, 5 gallons per shower, or over 100 million gallons of water daily , in CA alone. *** Cheap cost of installation and immediate returns on investment"},{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"By observing the RhoAI data dump of 2015 Californian home appliance uses through the use of R scripts, it becomes clear that water-heating is not only inefficient but also performed in an outdated manner. Analyzing several prominent trends drew important conclusions: many water heaters become large consumers of gasses and yet are frequently neglected, most likely due to the trouble in attaining successful installations and repairs.\n\nSo we set our eyes on a safe, cheap, and easily accessed water heater with the goal of efficiency and environmental friendliness. In examining the inductive heating process replacing old stovetops with modern ones, we found the answer. It accounted for every flaw the data decried regarding water-heaters, and would eventually prove to be even better."},{"heading":"How It Works","content":"Our project essentially operates in several core parts running simulataneously:\n\nArduino (101) Heating Mechanism Mobile Device Bluetooth User Interface Servers connecting to the IoT (and servicing via Alexa) Repeat all processes simultaneously\n\nThe Arduino 101 is the controller of the system. It relays information to and from the heating system and the mobile device over Bluetooth. It responds to fluctuations in the system. It guides the power to the heating system. It receives inputs via the Internet of Things and Alexa to handle voice commands (through the \"shower\" application). It acts as the peripheral in the Bluetooth connection with the mobile device. Note that neither the Bluetooth connection nor the online servers and webhooks are necessary for the heating system to operate at full capacity.\n\nThe heating mechanism consists of a device capable of heating an internal metal through electromagnetic waves. It is controlled by the current (which, in turn, is manipulated by the Arduino) directed through the breadboard and a series of resistors and capacitors. Designing the heating device involed heavy use of applied mathematics and a deeper understanding of the physics behind inductor interference and eddy currents. The calculations were quite messy but mandatorily accurate for performance reasons--Wolfram Mathematica provided inhumane assistance here. ;)\n\nThe mobile device grants the average consumer a means of making the most out of our water heater and allows the user to make informed decisions at an abstract level, taking away from the complexity of energy analysis and power grid supply and demand. It acts as the central connection for Bluetooth to the Arduino 101. The device harbors a vast range of information condensed in an effective and aesthetically pleasing UI. It also analyzes the current and future projections of energy consumption via the data provided by California ISO to most optimally time the heating process at the swipe of a finger.\n\nThe Internet of Things provides even more versatility to the convenience of the application in Smart Homes and with other smart devices. The implementation of Alexa encourages the water heater as a front-leader in an evolutionary revolution for the modern age."},{"heading":"Built With:","content":"(In no particular order of importance...)\n\nRhoAI R Balsamiq C++ (Arduino 101) Node.js Tears HTML Alexa API Swift, Xcode BLE Buckets and Water Java RXTX (Serial Communication Library) Mathematica MatLab (assistance) Red Bull, Soylent Tetrix (for support) Home Depot Electronics Express Breadboard, resistors, capacitors, jumper cables Arduino Digital Temperature Sensor (DS18B20) Electric Tape, Duct Tape Funnel, for testing Excel Javascript jQuery Intense Sleep Deprivation The wonderful support of the people around us, and TreeHacks as a whole.

Typically, digital ownership is verified using some external digital rights management tool, which becomes useless after the media has been decoupled from that application. By encoding signatures directly into the media itself, our system tries to bypass this issue, and offers a method for reliable authorship verification.\n\nFrom a technical point of view, we also wanted to explore ways to harness small perturbations (typically associated with adversarial input) for productive use. An adversarial example is an input created by an attacker which is specifically designed to trick a machine learning model to generate false output. Typically, they are viewed as a weakness of deep learning, but we propose that they can also be used as a method to encode images with messages that are extremely resilient to transformations and abuse."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Deep neural networks such as VGG16 and ResNet101 have been used to achieve state-of-the-art results in image classification. We combine these pretrained deep neural networks — whose parameters were expertly honed to detect salient shapes and features — along with stochastic connections and layers to develop a “decoder” model. This decoder acts as a robust, cryptographically-secure, transformation-invariant hash function for images, mapping input images to 32-bit codes.\n\nBy performing projective gradient descent on the decoder model with respect to a given image, we can use it to “sign” images robustly. We start with the original image, then repeatedly tweak the pixel values such that the image (and all transformations, including scaling, rotation, adding noise, blurring, random cropping, and more …) decodes to a specified 32-bit code. The resultant image will be almost imperceptible from the original image, yet contain an easily-decodable signature that cannot be removed even by the most dedicated of adversaries.\n\nWe apply this to the problem of giving creators a unique way to provide proof-of-authenticity for their work. In the website we developed, we enable users to embed Facebook profile IDs in images, and decode images to find the Facebook IDs of the people who authored them."},{"heading":"Applications","content":"The applications of this kind of technology are endless. Perhaps most saliently, it offers an almost-foolproof way to detect piracy. Even if pirated content is altered in exotic ways, through cropping, adding text, translations, color distortions, or more, the deep neural networks we developed will be able to detect it. It offers proof of authenticity for image content, providing a safety barrier against use of deepfakes/other video faking technology to stage hoaxes. It allows consumers to easily track down the creators of the content that they love.

Since we did not have enough carbon emission data in hand, we trained and evaluated our model on a energy consumption dataset, cause we found there is a strong correlation between the energy consumption data and the carbon emission data. Through this deep learning model, we can make a sound prediction of the carbon emission amount of the next month/year from the past emission history.\n\nFront end web interface\n\nWe built Web app where the user can access the real-time updates of their carbon consumption and balance, and the officials can suggest the currency value change based on the machine learning algorithm results shown in their own separate web interface."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Machine learning algorithms\n\nAt first we have no clue about what kind of model should we use for time series prediction.

The server continuously logs data from the Pi to Google Datastore.\n\nWe wrote a front end using D3.js and the Google Maps Javascript API to visualize pollutant information taken from the backend and place it on a map."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"We had trouble finding some of the necessary hardware components, such as a GPS module, so we had to simulate some location data for the sake of demonstration. Getting all the serial communications aligned proved challenging, as each of the three sensors had a different communications protocol.\n\nThere were a ton of issues getting Google App Engine and Datastore to work as a data logger, because Google's Protobuf API in Python doesn't work well with non standard data such as GeoPoints (Google's representation of latitude/longitude).\n\nMost hackathon projects are software hacks simply because software is much easier to work with. Because we decided to do a hybrid hardware-software hack, we ran into a bunch of small issues in trying to get the sensor module to upload to the backend, and then for the backend to get that data to the front-end visualization."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"We were able to lasercut an enclosure for Bairea, which was a fun process and resulted in a nice looking final product.\n\nWe think that this project serves as a really cool proof-of-concept for a cheap, mobile air quality sensor.\n\nWe're also really proud of making a successful hardware hack!"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"We learned a ton about building a reliable sensor module that uploads to a backend database.\n\nWe gained a lot of experience using D3.js to build powerful, informative data-visualizations."},{"heading":"What's next for Bairea","content":"We'd like to turn this proof of concept prototype into a real marketable product that people or researchers can attach to vehicles.\n\nWe'd also like to extend this sensor for use on drones, so that we can build 3D maps of air quality data."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino css d3.js flask google-app-engine google-maps html5 python raspberry-pi"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Birksun Solar Track","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/solar-track","tagline":"Find and connect with fellow Birksun Backpack users!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/605/256/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2018","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best application of Birksun Bags in a Social Community App"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"birksun","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"birksun"}]},{"project_title":"Memorium","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/memorium","tagline":"Conversational Memories with Alexa","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/603/390/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2018","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2018.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Voice Experience Using Amazon Alexa (Amazon) - 1st place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"alexa-skills-kit","url":null},{"name":"aws-cloudwatch","url":null},{"name":"aws-dynamodb","url":null},{"name":"aws-lambda","url":null},{"name":"azure-text-analytics-api","url":null},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/knowlsie/memorium"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"When it comes to mental health, being honest is the first step towards personal growth, and that honesty has to first start with yourself.

However, as this is not a possibility as of right now (though it may be in the near future), we spent a lot of time considering how to build around this limitation in order to perform sentiment analyses from limited data. Minor bugs in open-source code, which we hope to fix when we’re done hacking. Overall limitations of text analytics on small amounts of data (short texts)."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Implementing Microsoft Azure’s Text Analytics API into an Alexa Skill input to determine the sentiment value of a user’s memory, despite Alexa’s lack of support for phrases. A natural and clear conversation with Memorium. A well-implemented voice interface, featuring the ability to repeat messages, reprompt the user, and provide help messages at every stage.

It’s all from using the device."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to work around Alexa’s user input limitations and how to create natural conversations between Alexa and a user. Most importantly, we learned how to divide tasks among our team and how to play to everyone’s strengths."},{"heading":"What's next for Memorium","content":"Memorium is a versatile technology that can be expanded to have many applications. For instance:\n\nAs there is an improved raw speech-to-text data feature from Alexa on the horizon, we want to be the first to use this feature to change the way memories are shared. With this feature, we would be able to fully implement Memorium as a categorized repository of memories. With this addition, we hope to use new textual analysis APIs to create vector embeddings of sentences, so we can pull even more information from what users say. This will make conversations more natural, memory storage even better, and sentiment analysis more accurate. The concept of retrieving information from a memory repository is the foundation of Memorium, and it is tailored specifically for the purpose of allowing users to “journal” their memories and reflect on them. We see potential for this technology in the professional health industry, as therapists may utilize Memorium to inspire candor, self-awareness, and personal growth in their patients. One tentative idea is the possibility of storing a user’s memory as an audio file and then giving the option of replaying the memory in the user’s own voice. By doing this, we are not only storing the user’s words, but we are also keeping the emotional significance, as everyone has a unique way of sharing memories.\n\nOverall, Memorium has the potential to have a positive impact on mental health and change the way memories are kept."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"alexa-skills-kit aws-cloudwatch aws-dynamodb aws-lambda azure-text-analytics-api node.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Recycle Doctor","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/recycle-doctor-47mif2","tagline":"Third world countries are relatively uninformed about recycling.

We used the ARIMAS feature of the Pandas package in Python to make a least-squares prediction for the next month of energy usage of this given location. For another model, we used the Keras package with a Tensorflow backend in Python, creating a neural network with neural decomposition to predict the next month in the periodic pattern of the given time-series data. The second piece of the challenge was figuring out at what threshold to start discharging the battery to the grid. This was an interesting part of the challenge, and we decided to pose the problem as one of convex optimization.

Our device has multiple positive impacts: the educational aspect of encouraging children’s cognitive development skills and preparing them for serious, real-life situations; giving parents more peace of mind, knowing that their child can respond to dire situations; and providing a diverting, engaging game for children to feel like their favorite Marvel superhero while taking the necessary steps to save the day!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"On the software side, our first step was to find find images from comic books that closely resemble real-life emergency and crisis scenarios. We implemented our own comic classifier with the help of IBM Watson’s visual recognition service, classifying and re-tagging images made available by Marvel’s Comics API into crisis categories such as fire, violence, water disasters, or unconsciousness. The physical device randomly retrieves and displays these image objects from an mLab database each time a user mimics a 9-1-1 call. We used the Houndify conversational AI by SoundHound to interpret the voice recordings and generate smart responses. Different emergencies scenarios were stored as pages in Houndify and different responses from the child were stored as commands. We used Houndify’s smart expressions to build up potential user inputs and ensure the correct output was sent back to the Pi. Running on the Pi was a series of Python scripts, a command engine and an interaction engine, that enabled the flow of data and verified the child’s input. On the hardware end, we used a Raspberry Pi 3 connected to a Sony Eye camera/microphone to record audio and a small hdmi monitor to display a tagged Marvel image. The telephone 9-1-1 digits were inputted as haptic buttons connected to the Pi’s GPIO pins. All of the electronics were encapsulated in a custom laser cut box that acted as both a prototype for children’s toy and as protection for the electronics."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The comics from the Marvel API are hand-drawn and don’t come with detailed descriptions, so we had a tough time training a general model to match pictures to each scenario. We ended up creating a custom classifier with IBM Watson’s visual recognition service, using a few pre-selected images from Marvel, then applied that to the entirety of the Marvel imageset to diversify our selection. The next challenge was creating conversational logic flow that could be applied to a variety of statements a child might say while on the phone. We created several scenarios that involved numerous potential emergency situations and used Houndify’s Smart Expressions to evaluate the response from a child. Matching statements to these expressions allowed us to understand the conversation and provide custom feedback and responses throughout the mock phone call. We also wanted to make sure that we provide a sense of empowerment for the child. While they should not make unnecessary calls, children should not be afraid or anxious to talk with emergency services during an emergency. We want them to feel comfortable, capable, and strong enough to make that call and help the situation they are in. Our implementation of Marvel Comics allowed us provide some sense of super-power to the children during the calls."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our end product works smoothly and simulates an actual conversation for a variety of crisis scenarios, while providing words of encouragement and an unconventional approach to emergency response.
