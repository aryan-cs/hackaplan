With large—or even small—families, balancing different wants between different people, especially under a budget is one of the most stressful things before a large holiday like Christmas. That's why we developed a websites to not only help you find gifts but also do so realistically which fits tightly within your budget."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Provided with a list of gift keywords and a budget threshold, our website calculates a weight depending on the median price of each product given. Using this weight, we allocate portions of our budget towards different products and PresentPicker uses these portions along with the internet to find gifts that fit within the budget.

This is done using RealityKit and AVFoundation in Swift. We then connected the snapshots to a firebase storage, which is then accessible by a React app that displays all the images in a gallery. We deployed the website with Netlify and used Domain.com and displayed this website in the mobile app as a web view using Swift’s web view. This way, users can alternatively access the React website anywhere and not just in the app.\n\nOur Domain name is http://argallery.tech ."},{"heading":"🚩 Challenges we ran into","content":"2 of the 3 teammates were new to Swift and RealityKit, because of this development went slower than expected and we could not incorporate as many features as we wanted. We also had troubles uploading our images to our database so they could be used for our gallery website. The model we used with RealityKit did not work 100% initially so we had to modify the models for them to fit our needs. We also tried and to use Mongo Realm at first, but we decided to use Firebase instead after failing to upload images correctly from Swift. One of the team members is also new to hackathons and it was difficult to understand the idea of hackathons."},{"heading":"🥇 Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of the final product we have made, not only have we made an experience that is smooth and usable we also added features such as a beautiful UI that allows you to access our website gallery and the AR experience, we allow users to take pictures, and explore pictures from the community.

Users answer a set of multiple choice questions to help Santa narrow down gift choices that would best suit the user's assigned giftee.

From the myriad of songs that sing about the reprieve that a warm, toasty fire brings from the cold outdoors to the infinite number of movies that portray the beauty of winter, snow is as much a part of the holidays as anything else.\n\nUnfortunately, global temperature trends over the past few decades have led to less and less snowfall in many parts of the world. Global warming -- the gradual increase in global temperatures due to the injection of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through industrial processes -- not only threatens to deprive future generations of the joys of winter but also poses an existential threat to many species (including humans) through rising sea levels, intense weather, and loss of habitat.\n\nAs such, we were inspired to help combat this issue by creating a fun site that allows users to make their custom snowflakes and then send $DESO to help fight the climate crisis."},{"heading":"🎨 What it does","content":"We created an online sketch pad that enables even the most artistically challenged of us to make perfectly symmetrical snowflakes of any color.

This usually happens when a driver has not slept enough, but it can also happen because of untreated sleep disorders or shift work. Prescription and over-the-counter medications can also cause drowsiness, and alcohol can interact with sleepiness to increase both impairment and drowsiness.\n\nIt is a leading cause for traffic-accidents resulting in property loss, economic damage and deaths across the world. A survey of 19 countries across Europe revealed, that a median of 17% of all drivers have fallen asleep across all the countries that had taken the questionnaire. CDC revealed that 1 in every 25 adult drivers have fallen asleep at the steering wheel at least once in a month.\n\nThese starting figures how prevalent drowsy driving is.\n\nAn estimated 6,400 people died annually in crashes involving drowsy driving, according to the National Sleep Foundation."},{"heading":"Background","content":"Drowsy driving affects everyone, including adolescents and teens, who are not getting enough sleep (according to the CDC, it is recommended that teens get 8-10 hours of sleep each night). That means interventions focusing on this age group can help reduce drowsy driving. One such intervention is for parents to incorporate discussions and rules on drowsy driving while completing their parent-teen driving agreements.\n\nThe prime reasons which lead to Drowsy Driving include:\n\nPeople who don't get enough sleep . Commercial drivers operating vehicles such as tractor trailers, tow trucks, and buses ( long distance drive ). Drivers with untreated sleep illnesses such as one where breathing stop and begins constantly (sleep apnea). Drivers who use medicines that make them sleepy .\n\nLearn the warning signs of drowsy driving:\n\nYawning or blinking frequently. Trouble remembering the past few miles driven. Missing your exit. Drifting from your lane. Hitting a rumble strip on the side of the road.\n\nTaking into account all the above mentioned sources which show how prevalent drowsy sleeping is and more importantly, how it can occur at the most unforseeable of times.\n\nWe would like to present to you:"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"SnoozeSafe, is a concatenation of Snooze which literally means to have a short and light sleep, and Safe which means without danger. It is to signify our goal and mission to keep you safe from snoozing off during driving and keeping your attention on the road.\n\nIt is a tool that every driver must have in order to prevent the chances of drowsy driving, potential economic damage and possible danger to life. Our app, SnoozeSafe provides features which makes sure that while you are driving, your mind stays on the road and the road alone.\n\nBy taking direct camera feed from your device, it monitors your face for signs of drowsiness, until you turn it off. Once it notices any sign of you sleeping off, it will emit a high pitch alarm until it detect you have woken up. The app has the capability to detect your heartrate from the camera feed alone to help track of your attention as heartbest can also help detect sleepiness. Once the sessions ends, it provides you with analytics regarding the session, including the number of times you had snoozed off. It shows the analysis of the previous sessions in the form of a graph on the home screen. It also keeps a record of past sessions and analytic summary of those sessions for future need.\n\nAs sleeping disorders have a hand in causng drowsy driving, the records can help with tracking and diagonise undiagonised sleeping disorders."},{"heading":"How We Built It","content":"We were heavily inspired by the revised version of Double Diamond design process developed by UK Research Council, which not only includes visual design, but a full-fledged research cycle in which you must discover and define your problem before tackling your solution.\n\nDiscover : a deep dive into the problem we are trying to solve. Define : synthesizing the information from the discovery phase into a problem definition. Develop : think up solutions to the problem. Deliver : pick the best solution and build that.\n\nWe utilized design tools like Figma & Photoshop to prototype our designs and prepared a custom design palette before doing any coding. Through this, we are able to get iterative feedback so that we spend less time re-writing code.\n\nWe utilised the following technologies to create and produce the envisioned project:"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"A lot!

And as always, working overnight was pretty fun! :)\n\nA fully working prototype! This has been intense yet insightful journey. We are proud of the final product we designed and engineered within such a short timeframe. This is something we would recommend to our friends and family as we truly believe this is a quality application.
