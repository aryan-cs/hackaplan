Whether it be financial or environmental data, we saw an opportunity to use LLMs to allow for better understanding of big data. As a proof of concept, taking care of a house plant or gardens was interesting because we could collect data and take actions based on physical metrics like soil moisture and sunlight. We were then inspired to take managing plants to the next level by being able to talk to the data you just collected in a fun way, like asking how each of your plants are doing. This is how RoBotany came to be."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Through our web app, you can ask RoBotany about how your plants are doing - whether they need more water, have been overwatered, need to be in the shade, and many more questions. Each of your plants has a name, and you can ask specifically how your plant Jerry is faring for example. When you ask for a status update on your plants, our web app fetches data stored in our database, which gets a constant feed of information from the light and soil moisture sensors. If your plants are in need of water, you can even ask RoBotany to water your plants autonomously!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Hardware The hardware portion uses an Arduino, a photoresistor, and a soil moisture sensor to measure the quintessential environmental conditions of any indoor or outdoor plants. We even 3D-printed a flower pot specially made to hold a small plant and the Arduino system!\n\nFrontend Our frontend was built with React and uses the Chat UI Kit from chatscope.\n\nBackend Our project requires the use of two CockroachDBs. One of the databases is continuously read and updated for the soil moisture and light level, while the other database is updated less frequently to toggle the plant sprinkler system. Our simple yet practical endpoints allow us to seamlessly send information back and forth between our arduino and AWS EC2 instance, using technologies such as pm2 and nginx to keep the API up and running.\n\nNLP To process user requests via our chatbot, we used a combination of a classification model on BentoML to categorize requests, as well as Cohere Generation for entity extraction and responding to more generic requests.\n\nThe process goes as follows:\n\nThe user enters a prompt. The prompt gets sent to be categorized via BentoML. The input and category get sent to Cohere Generation, along with some training datasets, to extract entities. The category and entity get sent to a small class that processes and queries our CockroachDB via a Flask mini api. The response gets forwarded back to the user that sent the initial prompt."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the main challenges that we struggled with was working with LLMs, something none of our team was very familiar with. Despite being extremely challenging, we were glad we dove into the subject as deep as we did because it was equally rewarding to finally get it working.\n\nIn addition, given that our electronic system was handling water, we wanted to make sure that our packaging protected our ESP32 and sensor boards. We started by designing a 3D printed compartment that would house everything from the electronics, to the Motor, to the plant itself. We quickly discovered a compartment that size would take well over 12 hours (we are at T-10 hours at that point). We modified our design to make it more compact, and were able to get a beautiful packaging done in time!\n\nFinally, from CockroachDB to Cohere, our group was managing a couple different authentication systems. Between refreshing tokens, as well as group members constantly hopping on and off different components, we ran into an issue quickly in terms of how to share the tokens. The solution - was to use Syro’s secret management software."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our project had over a dozen unique technologies as our team looked to develop new skills and use new tech stacks during this hackathon."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Large Language Models (LLMs) How to connect multiple distinct technologies together in a single project Using a strongly-consistent database in CockroachDB for the first time Using object-relational mapping"},{"heading":"What's next for RoBotany","content":"Some possible next steps include diversifying our plant sensor data, as well as making it more scalable, allowing users to potentially talk to an entire crop field!\n\nIn addition, our system was designed with modularity in mind. Expanding to new, very different avenues of monitoring, shouldn’t be complex tasks. RoBotany lays the groundwork for a smart platform to talk to variable sensor data."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino bentoml cockroachdb cohere express.js node.js npm psycopg2 python react sequelize syro"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"PearPiano","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/pear-piano","tagline":"AR composing tool, bringing music to life, not just to your ears but to your eyes 🎶","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/590/387/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2023 Finalist"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"blender","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender"},{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"oculus-gear-vr","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/oculus-gear-vr"},{"name":"openai","url":null},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"},{"name":"whisper","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/JustinLin905/Pear-Piano"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration 🍐","content":"Composing music through scribbling notes or drag-and-dropping from MuseScore couldn't be more tedious.

In this case, we were drawn in by a motorized Audi Spyder car. And then, we saw the Neurosity Crown headsets, and an idea was born. A single late night call among team members, excited about the possibility of using a kiddy car for something bigger was all it took. Why can't we learn about cool tech and have fun while we're at it?\n\nSpyder is a way we can control cars with our minds. Use cases include remote rescue, non able-bodied individuals, warehouse, and being extremely cool."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Spyder uses the Neurosity Crown to take the brainwaves of an individual, train an AI model to detect and identify certain brainwave patterns, and output them as a recognizable output to humans. It's a dry brain-computer interface (BCI) which means electrodes are placed against the scalp to read the brain's electrical activity. By taking advantage of these non-invasive method of reading electrical impulses, this allows for greater accessibility to neural technology.\n\nCollecting these impulses, we are then able to forward these commands to our Viam interface. Viam is a software platform that allows you to easily put together smart machines and robotic projects. It completely changed the way we coded this hackathon. We used it to integrate every single piece of hardware on the car. More about this below! :)"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Mechanical\n\nThe manual steering had to be converted to automatic. We did this in SolidWorks by creating a custom 3D printed rack and pinion steering mechanism with a motor mount that was mounted to the existing steering bracket. Custom gear sizing was used for the rack and pinion due to load-bearing constraints. This allows us to command it with a DC motor via Viam and turn the wheel of the car, while maintaining the aesthetics of the steering wheel.\n\nHardware\n\nA 12V battery is connected to a custom soldered power distribution board. This powers the car, the boards, and the steering motor. For the DC motors, they are connected to a Cytron motor controller that supplies 10A to both the drive and steering motors via pulse-width modulation (PWM). A custom LED controller and buck converter PCB stepped down the voltage from 12V to 5V for the LED under glow lights and the Raspberry Pi 4. The Raspberry Pi 4 uses the Viam SDK (which controls all peripherals) and connects to the Neurosity Crown for vision software controlling for the motors. All the wiring is custom soldered, and many parts are custom to fit our needs.\n\nSoftware\n\nViam was an integral part of our software development and hardware bringup. It significantly reduced the amount of code, testing, and general pain we'd normally go through creating smart machine or robotics projects. Viam was instrumental in debugging and testing to see if our system was even viable and to quickly check for bugs. The ability to test features without writing drivers or custom code saved us a lot of time. An exciting feature was how we could take code from Viam and merge it with a Go backend which is normally very difficult to do. Being able to integrate with Go was very cool - usually have to do python (flask + SDK). Being able to use Go, we get extra backend benefits without the headache of integration! Additional software that we used was python for the keyboard control client, testing, and validation of mechanical and electrical hardware. We also used JavaScript and node to access the Neurosity Crown, Neurosity SDK and Kinesis API to grab trained AI signals from the console. We then used websockets to port them over to the Raspberry Pi to be used in driving the car."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Using the Neurosity Crown was the most challenging. Training the AI model to recognize a user's brainwaves and associate them with actions didn't always work. In addition, grabbing this data for more than one action per session was not possible which made controlling the car difficult as we couldn't fully realise our dream. Additionally, it only caught fire once - which we consider to be a personal best. If anything, we created the world's fastest smoke machine."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of being able to complete a full mechatronics system within our 32 hours. We iterated through the engineering design process several times, pivoting multiple times to best suit our hardware availabilities and quickly making decisions to make sure we'd finish everything on time. It's a technically challenging project - diving into learning about neurotechnology and combining it with a new platform - Viam, to create something fun and useful."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Cars are really cool! Turns out we can do more than we thought with a simple kid car. Viam is really cool! We learned through their workshop that we can easily attach peripherals to boards, use and train computer vision models, and even use SLAM! We spend so much time in class writing drivers, interfaces, and code for peripherals in robotics projects, but Viam has it covered. We were really excited to have had the chance to try it out! Neurotech is really cool!

These models take in an image through a camera feed, surrounding cars, the color of the surrounding traffic lights, and the size of the car plates in front of the drivers. By detecting car plates, we are able to infer the acceleration of a car (based on the change in size of the car plates), and are able to asses the driver's habits. By checking for red lights, correlated with the GPS data, we are able to determine a driver's reaction time, and can give a rating for a driver's capacities.

We've all had those moments where we felt a memory on the tip of our tongues but couldn't quite grasp it, like a fleeting dream slipping through our fingers. These fragments of the past hold immense value, as they connect us to our personal history, our emotions, and the people who have been a part of our journey. 🌟✨\n\nWe embarked on the journey to create DejaVu with the vision of bridging the gap between the past and the present, between what's remembered and what's forgotten. Our goal was to harness the magic of technology and innovation to make these elusive memories accessible once more. We wanted to give people the power to rediscover the treasures hidden within their own minds, to relive those special moments as if they were happening all over again, and to cherish the emotions they evoke. 🚀🔮\n\nThe spark that ignited DejaVu came from a profound understanding that our memories are not just records of the past; they are the essence of our identity. We wanted to empower individuals to be the architects of their own narratives, allowing them to revisit their life's most meaningful chapters. With DejaVu, we set out to create a tool that could turn the faint whispers of forgotten memories into vibrant, tangible experiences, filling our lives with the warmth of nostalgia and the joy of reconnection. 🧠🔑"},{"heading":"How We Built DejaVu 🛠️","content":"It all starts with the hardware component. There is a video/audio-recording Python script running on a laptop, to which a webcam is connected. This webcam is connected to the user's hat, which they wear on their head and it records video. Once the video recording is stopped, the video is uploaded to a storage bucket on Google Cloud. 🎥☁️\n\nThe video is retrieved by the backend, which can then be processed. Vector embeddings are generated for both the audio and the video so that semantic search features can be integrated into our Python-based software. After that, the resulting vectors can be leveraged to deliver content to the front-end through a Flask microservice. Through the Cohere API, we were able to vectorize audio and contextual descriptions, as well as summarize all results on the client side. 🖥️🚀\n\nOur front-end, which was created using Next.js and hosted on Vercel, features a landing page and a search page. On the search page, a user can search a query for a memory which they are attempting to recall. After that, the query text is sent to the backend through a request, and the necessary information relating to the location of this memory is sent back to the frontend. After this occurs, the video where this memory occurs is displayed on the screen and allows the user to get rid of the ominous feeling of déjà vu. 🔎🌟"},{"heading":"Challenges We Overcame at DejaVu 🚧","content":"🧩 Overcoming Hardware Difficulties 🛠️\n\nOne of the significant challenges we encountered during the creation of DejaVu was finding the right hardware to support our project.

However, for the actual movie generation, we used a massive, complex pipeline of AI-APIs. We first use Cohere to split the provided story plot into a set of scenes. We then use another Cohere API call to generate a list of characters, and a lot of their attributes, such as their type, description (for image gen), and most importantly, Actions. Each \"Action\" consists of a transformation (translation/rotation) in some way, and by interpolating between different \"Actions\" for each character, we can integrate them seamlessly into a 2D animation.\n\nThis framework for moving, rotating and scaling ALL sprites using LLMs like Cohere is what makes this project truly stand out. Had we used an Image Generation API like SDXL to simply generate a set of frames for our \"video\", we would have ended up with a janky stop-motion video.

Any folders uploaded by the user through the UI are stored using MongoDB. The backend is built using Python-Flask. If the user chooses a visualization, we first summarize what every file and folder does and display that in a graph data structure using the library pyvis. We analyze whether files are connected in the graph based on an algorithm that checks features such as the functions imported, etc. For the file-level visualization, we analyze the file's code using an AST and figure out which functions are interacting with each other. Finally for the chatbot, when the user asks a question we first use Cohere's embeddings to check the similarity of the question with the description we generated for the files. After narrowing down the correct file, we use its code to answer the question using Cohere generate."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We struggled a lot with narrowing down which file to use to answer the user's questions.

We also struggled with getting all of our tech stacks to work as we used React, MongoDB and Flask. Making the API calls seamless proved to be very difficult."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"This was our first time using Cohere's embeddings feature and accurately analyzing the result to match the best file.

This usecase is meant for in-person customer support interactions. Our platform also uses Genesys's Developer API (EstimateWaitTime) to calculate, for any given organization and queue, the wait time and backlog of customer support cases. It then combines these two forms of customer support, allowing customers to make informed decisions as to where to go for customer support, and giving organizations robust analytics for which customer support channels can be further optimized (such as hiring more people to serve as chat agents)."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"OpenCV along with a custom algorithm for people counting within a certain bounding area was used for the Computer Vision aspect to determine the number of people in a line, in-person.

Furthermore , there is always a possibility that two different dishes share an ingredient, but your experience is fully different! How do we adjust for that? Well naturally, that would imply that this ingredient is not the significant irritator, and we adjust the ratings according to both data points. Finally, the prediction function of the web app utilizes Cohere's AI endpoints to complete the predictions. Through use of Cohere's classify endpoint, we are able to train an algorithm which can classify a new dish into any of the three aforementioned categories, with relation to the previously acquired data!\n\nThe project was all built on Replit, allowing for us to collaborate and host it all in the same place!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into many challenges over the course of the project.

Without the constant nagging by parents to clean up after ourselves that we found at home and some slightly unorganized roommates, many shared spaces in our residences and apartments like kitchen counters became cluttered and unusable."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"CleanCue is a hardware product that tracks clutter in shared spaces using computer vision. By tracking unused items taking up valuable counter space and making speech and notification reminders, CleanCue encourages roommates to clean up after themselves. This product promotes individual accountability and respect, repairing relationships between roommates, and filling the need some of us have for nagging and reminders by parents."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The current iteration of CleanCue is powered by a Raspberry Pi with a Camera Module sending a video stream to an Nvidia CUDA enabled laptop/desktop. The laptop is responsible for running our OpenCV object detection algorithms, which enable us to log how long items are left unattended and send appropriate reminders to a speaker or notification services. We used Cohere to create unique messages with personality to make it more like a maternal figure. Additionally, we used some TTS APIs to emulate a voice of a mother."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our original idea was to create a more granular product which would customize decluttering reminders based on the items detected. For example, this version of the product could detect perishable food items and make reminders to return items to the fridge to prevent food spoilage. However, the pre-trained OpenCV models that we used did not have enough variety in trained items and precision to support this goal, so we settled for this simpler version for this limited hackathon period."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of our planning throughout the event, which allowed us to both complete our project while also enjoying the event. Additionally, we are proud of how we broke down our tasks at the beginning, and identified what our MVP was, so that when there were problems, we knew what our core priorities were. Lastly, we are glad we submitted a working project to Hack the North!!!!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"The core frameworks that our project is built out of were all new to the team. We had never used OpenCV or Taipy before, but had a lot of fun learning these tools. We also learned how to create improvised networking infrastructure to enable hardware prototyping in a public hackathon environment. Though not on the technical side, we also learned the importance of re-assessing if our solution actually was solving the problem we were intending to solve throughout the project and make necessary adjustments based on what we prioritized. Also, this was our first hardware hack!"},{"heading":"What's next for CleanCue","content":"We definitely want to improve our prototype to be able to more accurately describe a wide array of kitchen objects, enabling us to tackle more important issues like food waste prevention. Further, we also realized that the technology in this project can also aid individuals with dementia. We would also love to explore more in the mobile app development space. We would also love to use this to notify any dangers within the kitchen, for example, a young child getting too close to the stove, or an open fire left on for a long time. Additionally, we had constraints based on hardware availability, and ideally, we would love to use an Nvidia Jetson based platform for hardware compactness and flexibility."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cuda google-cloud opencv python raspberry-pi taipy tcp tts"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com unclutte.red momapproved.tech"}]},{"project_title":"DAG","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dag","tagline":"Decentralized data aggregation across all of machine learning.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/589/861/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Flow"},{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Soroban"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"cohere","url":null},{"name":"flow","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flow"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"next.js","url":null},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"soroban","url":null},{"name":"syro","url":null},{"name":"tailwindcss","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/Bobliuuu/DAG"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"The current landscape of data aggregation for ML models relies heavily on centralized platforms, such as Roboflow and Kaggle.
