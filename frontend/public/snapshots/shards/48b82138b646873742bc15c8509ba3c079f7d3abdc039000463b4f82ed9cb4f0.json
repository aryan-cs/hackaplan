The existing source files were not building in the windows environment, and hence the mesos-execute framework could not be tested along with the mesos-master and mesos-agent on a single machine having windows environment. With the existing code, if one wanted to test mesos on a windows machine, the mesos-master and mesos-execute had to be deployed in a virtual machine and the process was a bit cumbersome.\n\nShubham worked on adding a feature to apply-reviews.py link such that when apply-reviews.py is used on a review that has been submitted already, feedback is provided. Furthermore, Shubham investigated and found that the issue link had already been patched and a better version of code is already present in the repository but the issue is not closed. He closed it as is evident through the above link."},{"heading":"How We built it","content":"For porting mesos-execute and mesos-master to windows, we added preprocessor directives to avoid making calls to system calls that were not supported by the windows kernel. For fixing apply-reviews.py we added a warning lmessage that would inform the reviewer of an already applied review. ( https://reviews.apache.org/r/65795/diff/1#index_header )."},{"heading":"Challenges We ran into","content":"C++ code takes a long time to build. Building the code on ubuntu VM with 4GB of RAM with 2 GB linux swap. Even then it takes a couple of hours to build the source code for the first time. Also, Apache does not generally accept traditional Git pull requests for bug fixes. They have a separate process to submit code patches and different coding style requirement . Thankfully, the entire process was pretty straight forward with the help of to our mentor who pointed us to the existing code that was solving similar problems."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we are proud of","content":"One of us had never worked with Mesos and he enjoyed learning about the architecture of the Mesos project.

In developing and war-torn nations, it can be difficult to reliably verify the identity of these migrants. QPass is an application that uses smart contracts and the Quantum blockchain to provide individuals and organizations the ability to vouch for the location of others.\n\nFor example, a visitor to the United Kingdom would have his QPass verified the local customs officers. This visit and its distinguishing details are signed and stored on the Quantum blockchain, for all to see. Similarly, inhabitants of fallen governments might use their QPass ledger as proof of their previous citizenship as they work to establish a new home.\n\nQPass is built on the power on smart contracts, which allow the execution of credible transactions without the use of third parties. Our smart contract stores the verified location and time, as well as a signed copy of this data from the verifier. After being committed to the blockchain, this data is easily accessible to all QPass users.\n\nAs blockchain novices, our biggest hurdles involved becoming proficient in the skills necessary to leverage the Quantum blockchain.
