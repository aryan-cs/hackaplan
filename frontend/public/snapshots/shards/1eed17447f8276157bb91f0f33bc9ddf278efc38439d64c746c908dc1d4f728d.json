Traditional manual verification methods are time-consuming, subjective, and often miss subtle digital alterations.\n\nI was inspired by real-world cases where: - Legal contracts were invalidated due to undetected signature forgeries - Financial institutions lost money to document manipulation - Court cases hinged on proving document authenticity\n\nMy goal: democratize advanced document forensics using AI."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The Document Analysis Toolset is a comprehensive AI-powered platform that provides three core forensic capabilities with models trained using HP AI Studio on NVIDIA GPUs.\n\nThe system automatically detects and extracts signatures from PDF documents using YOLO-based object detection, processes multi-page documents in seconds, and allows users to download individual signature crops for further analysis.\n\nFor signature verification, the deep learning classifier compares two signature images to determine authenticity with confidence scoring, providing side-by-side visual comparisons and expert-level accuracy in distinguishing genuine signatures from forgeries. The manipulation detection module utilizes Error Level Analysis (ELA) to identify digitally altered areas in PDF documents, highlighting suspicious regions and tracking version changes to reveal tampering attempts that would be invisible to the naked eye.\n\nThe platform processes documents in real-time, supports multiple file formats, and presents results through clean, professional visualizations that make complex forensic analysis accessible to non-technical users."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"I built the system using a modern AI-first architecture. For the hosted web interface, I chose Streamlit for its rapid prototyping capabilities and clean presentation of complex data visualizations. The signature detection pipeline leverages a custom-trained YOLO model exported to ONNX format for optimized inference, while the forgery classification uses a fine-tuned Vision Transformer (ViT) model hosted on Hugging Face for the web versions, but both are also deployable for inference through HP AI Studio.\n\nMy development workflow utilized HP AI Studio for model experimentation and training, with an NVIDIA GPU (RTX 4070 Ti Super) providing the computational power needed for deep learning model development. I implemented MLFlow for experiment tracking and model versioning, ensuring reproducible results and systematic performance improvements. The manipulation detection module integrates PDF2Image for document conversion and PIL for advanced image processing operations.\n\nKey technical decisions included using PyTorch with ONNX export for production deployment, implementing caching decorators for model loading optimization, and designing modular components that could be easily extended. I structured the codebase with separate pages for each analysis type, shared utility functions for common operations, and custom CSS styling for a professional user experience."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the biggest challenges was optimizing model inference speed while maintaining accuracy. Initial implementations were too slow for real-time use, leading me to experiment with model quantization, ONNX optimization, and strategic caching. I also struggled with memory management when processing large PDF documents, ultimately implementing streaming approaches and efficient image handling.\n\nThe signature detection model required extensive data preprocessing and augmentation to handle the wide variety of signature styles, document qualities, and scanning artifacts found in real-world documents."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"I successfully created a production-ready document forensics platform that rivals expensive specialized software, making advanced AI accessible through a simple web interface. The signature detection achieves over 95% precision across diverse document types, while the forgery classification model demonstrates over 90% accuracy in distinguishing authentic from forged signatures.\n\nThe technical architecture is both scalable and maintainable, with clean separation of concerns and modular components that facilitate future development.\n\nThe Error Level Analysis implementation successfully identifies subtle digital manipulations that would be missed by manual inspection, providing forensic investigators with a powerful new tool for document authentication. The entire system processes documents in real-time, making it practical for high-volume use cases in professional environments.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, this demonstrates that advanced AI capabilities can be democratized - bringing laboratory-grade document forensics to any professional who needs it, regardless of technical background or budget constraints."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This project taught me valuable lessons about productionizing machine learning models and the importance of user-centered design in AI applications. I learned that model accuracy is only one piece of the puzzle - inference speed, memory efficiency, and result interpretability are equally crucial for real-world deployment."},{"heading":"What's next for Document Analysis Toolset","content":"My immediate roadmap includes expanding the signature verification model to handle a broader range of signature styles and document types, implementing ensemble methods to combine multiple detection approaches for higher accuracy, and adding support for additional document formats beyond PDF."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"hp-ai-studio mlflow python streamlit"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"doctools.streamlit.app github.com"}]},{"project_title":"AffectLink","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/affectlink","tagline":"AffectLink provides real-time multimodal emotion insights for tele-health with HP AI Studio.

Traditional tele-health lacks the rich emotional context present in in-person interactions. This inspired AffectLink , a project aimed at empowering mental health professionals with deeper, data-driven insights into patient emotions during virtual sessions, ultimately improving care."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"AffectLink is a real-time, local-first AI application designed to provide comprehensive emotional analysis by processing three key modalities: facial expressions, speech tone (audio emotion), and spoken content (text emotion) . Our core innovation, the Emotional Consistency Index (ECI) , synthesizes these independent emotional streams, highlighting when a patient's verbal message might diverge from their non-verbal cues. For example, a patient might say \"I'm fine,\" but their facial expression or tone suggests underlying distress. AffectLink surfaces these critical discrepancies, acting as a powerful tool for clinicians to identify unexpressed emotions and guide their therapeutic approach. All processing occurs securely and locally on the HP workstation, ensuring patient privacy and HIPAA compliance."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"AffectLink was built from the ground up to showcase the power and security of HP AI Studio for real-time, on-device AI inference. Our technical workflow is as follows:\n\nData Capture: Live video and audio streams are captured from the user's webcam and microphone. Orchestration ( main_processor.py ): This central component manages the overall pipeline, distributing data to specialized AI modules and aggregating their results. Facial Emotion Analysis: Video frames are sent to a Video Emotion Processor which utilizes DeepFace (running locally). While we aimed for full AI Studio integration, due to specific complexities encountered during the hackathon timeframe, DeepFace is currently executed directly via its Python library to detect and classify facial expressions in real-time on the local machine. Audio Processing: Audio chunks are sent to an Audio Pre-processor . This module prepares the audio for the deployed AI models. HP AI Studio Integration (Swagger API): This is a core highlight. Our Whisper (ASR) model for speech-to-text transcription, our Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) model for vocal tone analysis, and our Text Emotion model (for analyzing transcribed text) are all successfully registered and deployed locally via HP AI Studio's Swagger API . This ensures secure, high-performance, and on-device inference without cloud dependency for these critical AI components. Multimodal Fusion: The main_processor.py receives results from all modalities (facial, audio emotion, text emotion, and transcription). It then calculates the Emotional Consistency Index , providing a unified view of the patient's emotional state. Data Visualization (Streamlit): All processed data, including live video frames and emotion metrics, are written to local temporary files ( affectlink_emotion.json , affectlink_frame.jpg ). This method of inter-process communication was chosen for efficient real-time updates. The AffectLink Streamlit UI dashboard then reads these files, providing an intuitive, interactive display for clinicians. MLflow Tracking: Throughout the development process, MLflow was leveraged within HP AI Studio to track experiments, manage model versions, and log metrics, ensuring full reproducibility and control over our AI models."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Real-time Performance: Balancing complex multimodal AI models with real-time performance on local hardware was a significant challenge. We optimized frame processing rates and experimented with different model sizes (e.g., Whisper 'tiny' or 'base'). Synchronization: Ensuring accurate synchronization between video frames, audio chunks, and their corresponding emotional analyses was crucial for the ECI. We implemented robust timestamping and buffering mechanisms. DeepFace Integration with AI Studio Deployment: We encountered integration complexities with the DeepFace library within the hackathon's compressed timeline. This led us to handle facial emotion analysis locally via direct Python library calls rather than deploying it via AI Studio's Swagger API like our other models. HP AI Studio Deployment: Configuring and deploying other models (ASR, SER, Text Emotion) to the local Swagger API within HP AI Studio required careful attention to environment dependencies and API endpoint definitions."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Successful Local-First AI Deployment with HP AI Studio: We successfully registered and deployed our Whisper (ASR), Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), and Text Emotion models locally via HP AI Studio's Swagger API, demonstrating secure, high-performance, and on-device inference without cloud dependency.

Medical professionals are overwhelmed with increasing patient loads while facing pressure to make accurate, timely diagnoses. We observed that:\n\nAI mistrust in healthcare stems from \"black box\" systems that provide no explanation for their decisions Diagnostic delays can be life-threatening, especially in emergency settings Medical imaging expertise is scarce in underserved regions Human error in medical diagnosis affects millions of patients annually Second opinions are often unavailable or delayed in critical situations\n\nThe Interpretability Crisis in Medical AI\n\nA pivotal moment in our inspiration came from conversations with radiologists who expressed deep skepticism about existing AI diagnostic tools. They shared frustrating experiences with AI systems that would flag potential diseases but provide no explanation of their reasoning. One radiologist told us: \"I can't stake my medical license on a system that won't show me why it thinks there's a problem. If I can't understand the AI's reasoning, how can I trust it with my patients' lives?\"\n\nThis highlighted a fundamental barrier to AI adoption in healthcare:\n\nTrust requires transparency : Medical professionals need to understand AI decision-making processes Clinical accountability : Doctors remain legally responsible for diagnoses, requiring explainable AI recommendations Educational value : Interpretable AI can serve as a teaching tool for medical students and residents Bias detection : Visual explanations help identify when AI models focus on irrelevant image artifacts Quality assurance : Interpretability enables validation that AI is \"looking\" at clinically relevant anatomical regions\n\nOpenMed's Answer: Visual AI Explanations\n\nOur GradCAM visualization technology addresses the interpretability crisis by showing exactly which brain regions influenced the AI's tumor detection decision. The heat map overlay allows radiologists to validate that the AI is focusing on medically relevant anatomical structures, building trust through transparency.\n\nWe were particularly moved by stories of:\n\nRural hospitals lacking radiologists for urgent chest X-ray interpretations Developing countries with limited access to specialized medical imaging expertise Medical students and residents needing better training tools for pattern recognition Patients waiting weeks for specialist consultations that could be expedited with AI assistance\n\nThe vision was clear : Create an AI system that doesn't replace medical professionals but empowers them with intelligent, interpretable, and trustworthy assistance. We wanted to democratize access to advanced medical imaging analysis while maintaining the highest standards of clinical accuracy and transparency.\n\nOur Interpretability-First Approach\n\nWe recognized that for medical AI to gain widespread adoption, interpretability couldn't be an afterthought—it had to be foundational. Our mission became:\n\nBuild trust through transparency : Every AI decision comes with visual explanations showing which image regions influenced the diagnosis Enable clinical validation : Provide tools for medical professionals to verify that AI reasoning aligns with medical knowledge Foster AI-human collaboration : Create a partnership where AI augments human expertise rather than obscuring it Accelerate medical education : Transform AI explanations into powerful learning tools for the next generation of healthcare providers Ensure ethical AI deployment : Maintain accountability and prevent algorithmic bias through interpretable systems\n\nThis interpretability-first philosophy guided every design decision, from our GradCAM visualization system to our conversational AI interface that explains medical reasoning in plain language."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"OpenMed is a comprehensive AI-powered medical imaging analysis platform that revolutionizes how healthcare professionals approach diagnostic imaging.

Now, with AI tools writing code faster than ever, we’re seeing an ironic gap: speed has increased — but product quality hasn’t. Teams can generate code in seconds, but if that code doesn’t reflect the latest meeting decisions, it's just fast wrong work. We were inspired by this growing mismatch between decision-making and implementation .\n\nPMs spend hours manually checking Jira tickets. Developers unknowingly violate specs that were never updated. We asked: What if an AI could watch over these processes and enforce alignment? That’s how Codence was born — to make sure product consensus becomes code reality.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned that:\n\nMeeting notes are messy, but full of hidden structure. Developers don’t ignore specs—they often never see them. The gap between decisions and delivery is often process, not intent.\n\nWe also realized how powerful LLMs can be when paired with source-of-truth systems like Jira and GitLab.\n\nHow we built it\n\nFrontend : A minimal web interface for uploading meeting notes and reviewing suggestions. Backend : Python + FastAPI with GitLab webhook integration. AI : GPT-based models extract decisions and rules from unstructured meeting notes. DevOps : GitLab Webhook triggers Codence to validate PRs against extracted rules. Jira Integration : Syncs ticket updates through REST APIs after human approval.\n\nChallenges we faced\n\nParsing casual, non-standard meeting notes into structured intent. Mapping natural language decisions to specific Jira tickets and code actions. Avoiding false positives in code rule checks while keeping responses fast. Making the AI explain why something violates a rule in human-readable terms.\n\nDespite the constraints of time and scope, we’re proud that Codence brings alignment closer to automation."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ai-studio docker flask hp openai python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"QuantumFinance AI","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/quantumfinance-ai","tagline":"Your AI copilot for the stock market.

I ran my entire FastAPI backend within its stable, containerized environment. This allowed me to rapidly test and debug countless API calls and data pipelines without ever worrying about system conflicts. As I iterated through hundreds of prompt variations, especially for the nuanced sentiment and risk analysis features, keeping track of what worked was critical. HP AI Studio's built-in MLflow integration was a lifesaver.

When not hosting API endpoint I can offload and spin up models based on requirements but here all endpoints that is needed to run the solution should be up and running, which does not help in GPU constraint situations."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Successfully deploying a fully offline virtual try-on system Maintaining a high standard of visual realism while keeping the app lightweight Enabling complete user privacy—images never leave the device Making it easy and intuitive for anyone to try on clothes virtually -Registered the model on AI Studio"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Gained hands-on experience in registering and managing models in AI Studio, which helped streamline model versioning and deployment Learned to leverage HP AI Studio to assist with deploying the virtual try-on pipeline"},{"heading":"What's next for TRYON","content":"Include a text to image search that allows users to search through different clothing items"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ai hp python studio transformers"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Orpheus Engine","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/orpheus-engine","tagline":"The Orpheus Engine Workspace, the AI-powered DAW for audio restoration and analysis, offering seamless cross-device use and diverse plugin support for music, gaming, and data science!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/466/276/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HP & NVIDIA Developer Challenge","hackathon_url":"https://hpaistudio.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Bonus Honorable Mention: Technology"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"graphql","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/jhead12/orpheus-engine"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"The Orpheus Engine Workspace is a Digital Audio Workstation that enables users to perform audio restoration and analysis with the assistance of an AI agent. The app is designed to work seamlessly within any environment, allowing users to continue their research in the browser, on desktops, and mobile devices. The use of various data technologies designed as plugins for diverse audio exports that include metadata or analysis results critical for audio applications. The OEW has input with various audio devices, nRF (Bluetooth), audio interfaces, and MADI. The use of the HP Ai Studio can leverage the CPU and GPU, enabling the use of more dynamic and pro-level processing plugins, which can be utilized for Gaming, music, and data science projects."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"An audio professional will use Orpheus Engine Workspace to edit, analyze, and export data, while having an AI companion for research and the audio analysis from the visual process. With the recording capabilities, this allows a user to record from Bluetooth devices into the DAW, where the agent rag can analyze the audio data, identify the audio recordings for specific needs or suggestions of the Audio engineer. If the audio is a voice or speech, the AI will be able to conduct actions such as audio transcriptions, slice the sections of the audio when the user searches. To later be exported with metadata, or the transcript to be used for further development."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built this App using available TypeScript components and the demos of the HP Studio to help design the MLFlow and the Jupyter notebooks. A lot of the design and implementation was done using AI. The approach began with the backend, but I had to adjust and redesign the frontend to work within a browser, where the components were only displayed in Electron. This itself posed many challenges."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The main challenge was fixing all the dependency issues with the components. So I designed a new test suite and refactored all the code to work seamlessly with the browser. This was one of the many other challenges. I began using a model from HuggingFace, later utilized the model within the HP AI Studio."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Got it to work! Due to this project's complexity, there have been drawbacks; however, to get it working, many of the features I wanted to incorporate are only mockups. The Plugin Management systems and some of the uses of the nRF devices are not fully tested."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"I learned how to prioritize the usage of the App rather than how it is built. With larger projects that have a UI with many components, operating front-end testing suites and MLFlow helps keep track of the development processes."},{"heading":"What's next for Orpheus Engine","content":"I want to see the Orpheus Engine functioning as a dDapp. I would love for this DAW to be available on AI platforms, repositories, as a decentralized source for exporting audio projects to Web3. With the framework of the plugin store system, OEW can allow other developers to construct apps for processes such as Minting, saving data to a Vector database, and IP plugins ( using Story for securing the rights of the audio) to a plugin. OEW multiple input plugin (VST, Python, Typscript, dApp) design allows an audio pro to use their preferred DAW, and this tool will be the bridge to exporting audio files to Web3."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"graphql python typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:53:35.287163Z"}}
