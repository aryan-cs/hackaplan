We were tired of the limitations of traditional music streaming services, whose music recommendation system never catered to the moment. We wanted to create a platform to help music lovers like ourselves connect with others who shared similar tastes. At Soundscape, we strive to bring people together through the universal language of music and offer a unique way to discover new songs that express our moods."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"This program is designed to connect users with similar music tastes and preferences. It does this by analyzing the user's top tracks, artists, and genres, and then comparing that data with other users to determine compatibility. The program also gathers data from the user's Spotify accounts and creates playlists based on their current emotions and historical preferences. To classify emotions, the application listens to the user speak about how they are feeling and determine the sentiment associated with their speech."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The backend was built using Python and Flask, and the front end was built using React Native and Expo, allowing us to develop for both Android and iOS at the same time. We managed our data with CockroachDB. Using psycopg2, we created tables to store user credentials, user preferences, song information, compatibility between users, and current feed information (see media for a detailed visualization). We also used CockroachDB to generate a secret key for the encryption of sensitive data and also used it to generate unique identifiers for each user. We used Google Cloud’s services to convert user audio to text and analyze the sentiment of the data to recommend music to the users."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into challenges in several areas. To start, due to our lack of experience using CockroachDB, we found it difficult to debug certain aspects of our database system. For instance, we were running into an error which was telling us that we didn’t have the correct certificate for a database transaction, but we eventually worked around this by changing an SSL setting. Additionally, the Spotify API was difficult to work with; in particular, figuring out how to use OAuth 2.0 on a mobile device took us several hours."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re proud of our overall end product, especially, completing it in such a short time period. The ability of our app to hear sentiment from our voice input and create a playlist for a moment is a functionality we are really proud of."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned to use many different technologies during this project. Specifically, our team became more proficient in Flask as well as writing and creating an app. Additionally we learned how to integrate different features for frontend such as integrating web authentication."},{"heading":"What's next for Soundscape","content":"We look to add functionality to play music within the app as well. We might also look into implementing functionalities to check into people about how they’re doing after seeing their emotions."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroachdb expo.io flask google-cloud natural-language-processing postgresql python react-native spotify"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com"}]},{"project_title":"LectureBoost","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/lectureboost","tagline":"LectureBoost provides a quick method to study for class by cutting out downtime and quiet moments during presentations, leaving you more time to learn.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/353/049/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake X","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-x.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Place Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"amazon-web-services","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-web-services"},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/kckang1103/LectureProcessing"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"The idea behind LectureBoost was inspired by finals at Purdue. One of the best methods to review all the concepts covered in a class is to rewatch lectures from early in the semester to refresh your memory. However, lectures (and sometimes lecturers) can be extremely slow. Without so much downtime in a lecture there would be more time to get in all the studying you need before your big exams."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"LectureBoost provides 3 main functionalities: white space removal, audio transcription/subtitle creation, video text recognition/notes compilation. All functionalities are brought together in a webpage hosted on AWS.\n\nWhite space removal: Edits out the downtime from a video. This removes spaces in between sentences and cuts out long pauses. Subtitle creation: Subtitles are matched up with the frames of the lecture and integrated into the video. Audio transcription: Audio from the video is converted to text at 10 second intervals and added to a downloadable text file. Notes Compilation: Unique frames from the video are added to a downloadable pdf file. Video text recognition: Text from unique frames of the video is recorded and added to a downloadable text file."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"White space removal : Separating the audio (.wav) from a video (.mp4) allows us to analyze it byte by byte. After a 4-byte \"data\" tag, following bytes represent sound amplitudes. Converting these data bytes into decibels allows us to cut out all values below our threshold. Then, finding contiguous bytes below our decibel threshold allows us to determine ranges that will be cut out of the video. Audio analysis is done by hand and video trimming is done with the moviepy python library.\n\nSubtitle creation/Audio transcription : Uses speech recognition to aggregate text from speech every interval. Decode the video and add subtitles using the aggregated text and also create a transcription text data with time stamps to allow users to search through lectures. The speech recognition is done by SpeechRecognition python library.\n\nNotes Compilation/Video text recognition : Uses text recognition on frames that are captured through out the video. To avoid duplication, a pair of frames are compared using Mean Squared Error on pixel values and sequence matching on text scraped from the frames. The feature creates a pdf file that appends all the frames from the lecture that includes text. It also generates a text file with time stamps that matches with the slides.\n\nWebpage : The webpage is built with a Reactjs frontend web-application where we can take mp4 files and other user input about preferences. The frontend relies on the python-flask-driven backend which performs the desired operations on the given video file. The backend then stores the new video file in an AWS S3 bucket where it can be accessed by the user."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"amazon-web-services flask javascript python react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Insight","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/insight-m0ew74","tagline":"know every bump on the road.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/353/285/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake X","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-x.devpost.com/","prize_name":"1st Place Prize"},{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake X","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-x.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Innovative Data Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"cockroach-db","url":null},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"digitalocean","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/digitalocean"},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"ios","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"leaflet.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/leaflet-js"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"openstreetmap","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/openstreetmap"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"xcode","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode"},{"name":"yolo","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/knightron0/insight"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroach-db css digitalocean flask html ios javascript leaflet.js machine-learning openstreetmap python pytorch swift xcode yolo"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Write Right","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/write-right-b9zp58","tagline":"Use AR Technology to learn to write!

Our goal is to help people learn to write, so one of the main ways you can upload a stencil is by inserting text. Users can use the speech button for those who do not know how to type. Additionally we used an API to convert other languages to English for those who speak a foreign language. Lastly, you can upload an image that works as a stencil. In the Camera Scene, the text-converted-to-image stencil or the uploaded image would be placed onto a page that the camera detects using an analysis algorithm. Pointers can be used to help specify bounds. The user would proceed to trace over the text/image to practice writing/drawing."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We utilized a variety of opencv filters and contours to detect a piece of paper in the camera. We then used a homography matrix to project the stencil onto the paper. The flask backend would communicate the camera feed with the react native front end where the app UI was built, but there were some bugs in this process that led to issues. The camera would analyze the feed, detect the page, and then overlay the image after computing the location and the distortion needed on the stencil image."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Detecting the paper without the use of deep learning image segmentation was difficult. Especially when the paper was covered by a hand or pencil. Additionally, there was a host of issues that came into play about connecting Flask and React since we wanted to transmit a live video stream at all times from both ends. In the end, we attempted to modify a single image dynamically, but even this had its issues."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of obtaining a system that is capable of detecting pages and accounting for the change in perspective on the projection of the stencil on the paper."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned about image detection and AR Technologies as well as grasping a more in depth understanding of Flask, React, and opencv."},{"heading":"What's next for Write Right","content":"We would be fine-tuning the app and fixing the connection issues between the backend and frontend servers.

That is why we decided to make AirQ, a versatile machine learning model to predict air quality data based on a widely customizable range of inputs and parameters. Trained with data from UC Irvine, is is capable of informing researchers and the general population about future air quality well in advance. Many people don't take wildfires/smoke seriously but it is critical to have early warning systems in place that monitor air quality and can notify residents in advance to close their windows and stay indoors."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"This is a LSTM and seq2seq model (transformer-like model) that predicts specified air quality metrics using input and output features (data columns). One can select the input feature(s), desired output feature(s), loookback range, and prediction range to see which input features have the most weight in determining the output features. One can also experiment with adjusting the models, their architecture, and other hyper parameters without worry about the the implementation. It is built using Pytorch, with DVC and MLflow to allow for easy testing and augmentation through the constant.py file."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Preparing the data\n\nWe started by finding a data set on air quality, which we found in UC Irvine’s data archive. We then preprocessed this data. To do this we first interpolated missing/malformed data points, and then normalized the data between 0 and 1 to make it ready for training. After preparing the data, we split it into training and validation sets and batched it. We then created custom datasets and loaded them into dataloaders to be used by our model.\n\nDesigning the model:\n\nFor our model design, we initially started with an LSTM, but after training it, we noticed that even with any combination of hidden layers or lstm cells, the model would struggle with predicting two or more time steps ahead which is why we switched to using a seq2seq model, commonly used in NLP techniques. Such models are based on an encoder-decoder architecture:\n\nData is fed to the encoder, and we store the hidden state for the last timestep in the encoder we take the last input, and the last hidden state, and feed it into the decoder which produce the required hidden states We pass this through a linear layer to decrease the output dimensions from the hidden size to the desired amount of outputs and a new input state to the model. This process continues until we generate the required amount of time steps\n\nTraining the model:\n\nLearning Rate:\n\nWe selected a learning rate of 0.001 and a ExponentialLR scheduler from pytorch with Gamma = 0.99 to exponentially decay the learning rate by gamma as we move through the epochs.\n\n(see more in main.ipynb )\n\nEpochs:\n\nWe train for 1000 epochs, saving a model whenever we reach a new best validation loss.\n\nOptimizer:\n\nWe use a MSEloss to calculate the loss between our quantitative outputs.\n\nVersion Control\n\nWe use DagsHub with DVC for our data, git for our code, and MLflow to analyze the training results.\n\n(see more in dags_hub config )"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"implementing the seq2seq model We decided to use batches and therefore had to adjust the dimensions from batch,past_time_steps,features to past_time_steps,batches,features . This lead to bugs and we still occasionally receive a model that would predict the same sequence every time because of this. Configuring Dagshub\n\nWe have grow accustomed to storing all of our data in a single github repo so it took more time to configure a Dagshub repo, learn about DVC, MLflow, but after doing this, we saw the clear benefits of using Dagshub and our development became faster, we didn't have to worry about loosing our weights for each training run, and had a clear split between our data, code files, and ML runs.\n\nTime\n\nWe were also constrained by the limited time of this event, which caused us to not be able to finish the GUI."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of building our first version controlled project through DagsHub with DVC and MLFlow. Furthermore, this was our first attempt at creating a transformer-like model which didn't have a lot of existing implementation for non-NLP data, so we had to look into each layer, track the matrix multiplications and really understand the model instead of simply using a provided abstraction."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Coming into this project, both of us were unfamiliar with dagshub. We had to learn how to integrate our work with their systems and use it to manage the data pipeline for our model. Additionally, one of our team members came into this hackathon without any prior machine learning experience and had to learn the basics during the hackathon. We will both start using DagsHub for all of our ML projects as there are clear benefits to spliting up data and preventing our google drives from filling up with final_weights.pkl , FINAL.pkl and so on."},{"heading":"What's next for AirQ","content":"If we had more time on this project, we would create a deployable model with a frontend GUI that users could use to dynamically interact with the model and input their own testing data. We would also continue debugging the transformer to really understand why it would give such weird outputs."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"dagshub dvc git mlflow pandas python pytorch"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"dagshub.com"}]},{"project_title":"Oh Deere Farms","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/oh-deere-farms","tagline":"Ever wanted to try out a life of farming, but didn't want to deal with the ramifications?

Specifically, our tile mapping system was based on John Deere’s equivalent maps generated from real world data and modeled by a pin worn by one of their representatives."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Upon launch, our game procedurally generates a map that the player is able to navigate and farm via planting, fertilizing, and harvesting. Planted crops will automatically grow and develop in the background, even if the user is not nearby. The player’s goal is to reach 1000 coins by growing and farming different plants and using the profits to unlock new plants. With this, there are countless strategies to play through each game and, with the map ever-changing, each playthrough will be different than the last. In addition to coins, the player also has to keep in mind their water usage, as water is a crucial resource to allocate planting.\n\nAdditionally, we implemented 3 different soil-measurement maps to show various integral climate impacts of farming: tillage count, usage of the same crop, and fertilizer consumption. These 3 maps can be displayed using the B, N, and M keys and can be accessed at any time to show the abundant impacts of crop growth."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our game was built in 100% Python utilizing the PyGame package. Royalty-free sprites, music, sound effects, and art were retrieved from a variety of sources, including https://opengameart.org/ and https://bigsoundbank.com/ ."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Challenges were inevitable for the development of this project. One major issue was rendering the tiles in frame. While it took several attempts, we ultimately brainstormed and designed an appropriate algorithm: keep the player in the middle of the map and move the background around them. Furthermore, the stress of a hackathon was a persistent obstacle, intensifying as the deadline approached. We, as a team, pulled an all-nighter to put the finishing touches on Oh Deere Farms. In total, the work time was about 25 hours over 2 days."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of the amount of coding, game design, and overall participation in the limited that we were given. This has been the first ever hackathon that everyone on the team has participated in, and we are all very proud of each other for being able to face the adversity and challenges given and then overcame. Seeing our hard work, team synergy, and planning come to fruition to create a functional and enjoyable game was nothing short of amazing."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"First, we learned how to better work as a team. We resolved a lot of git merge conflicts and figured out how to best approach a problem. Additionally, we learned a lot about implementing PyGame, which we had never used before."},{"heading":"What's next for Oh Deere Farms and Team Timmy","content":"In the future, we would like to make the rain amount be based on a variety of aspects, including, but not limited to, soil quality to teach users to care for the land impacts of crop grow and the ability for a sustainable future. Additionally, we would like to add more biomes that can impact the rain, crop types, and growth speed of different crops. This will ensure the app is more realistic and relatable to more people in different areas of the world; and require the users to be more adaptable to their strategies within the game.\n\nIn the future, Team Timmy plans to participate in more hackathons!\n\nP.S.

Commercial solutions often sacrifice security in the name of profit, and this negligence trickles down to users in negative ways. We wanted to create Cryptum, a file storage app that does better by utilizing the Tillitis TKey technology to ensure that a user's data is secure."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The Tillitis TKey contains a chip that can run secure firmware. This means that cryptographic protocols can be implemented in such a way that requires the possession of a specific TKey. The website provides an easy-to-use UI to securely log in and handle the encryption/decryption of all files. Users can store and retrieve files while being sure that their data is safe."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used many different technologies in the development of Cryptum. For the frontend and backend of the website, we used node, svelte and typescript. To store user information, we used CockroachDB, and to store the files themselves, we used Google Cloud Object Storage Buckets. We also interfaced with the Tillitis TKey with C code, using WebUSB to flash a binary file and allow for file encryption/decryption. For the domain, we used domain.com to gain access to a fitting hostname."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Due to the complexity of our project, there were numerous problems with each component and their interoperability. On the hardware side, interfacing with the TKey was quite difficult, given that WebUSB is a relatively new technology. We were also forced to learn about implementations of cryptographic protocols and their best practices, which were quite new to us. CockroachDB, which we used for our general information database, also had TLS certificate issues, and we both lost time and had to find a way around those."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are quite proud of our landing page, which contains a blender animation we made just for this.
