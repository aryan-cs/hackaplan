The obvious question we had to ask ourselves is what would it take to use our skills as programmers to contribute to this culture of our generation. So we set out to answer the question: Can you dance as well as Addison Rae?"},{"heading":"What it does 👀","content":"Smart Dance uses pose estimation to store the key points of dances from popular dance videos and use those poses to guide the user on how to move their body to do the dance. Through our intuitive UI, users can find trending dances and learn or assess how well they're dancing when compared to their friends or internet stars that also do these dances. The score function we've made allows users to determine whether their pose is similar or different to the videos they are dancing along with. This makes dancing (and learning to dance) much more engaging as well as opens the door to the gamification of dancing with real-time feedback and encouragement (much like how the classic dance arcade games used to work). The only difference is our solution is not just enjoyable but is portable, easy to play and can be integrated with a lot more going forward!"},{"heading":"How we built it 💡","content":"Smart-Dance uses Python on the backend, Mediapipe for real time pose estimation on CPUs and GPUs paired with OpenCV, as well as Flask, HTML / CSS, and MongoDB for the frontend-backend-integration."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into 🌋","content":"Some challenges we ran into included calibrating the TikTok dances to the user's position. After wracking our brains for a while and doing some linear algebra, we came up with a mechanism to transform the coordinates of the poses so the keypoints of the dancer the user is following is where the user's pose is within frame. Another challenge was constructing a metric to compare the two poses in a meaningful manner and we discovered that l2_normalization was a very effective way of doing this comparison (we also explored using dynamic time warping matching as a metric and believe there is potential in applying this in the future)."},{"heading":"What we learned 🤠","content":"How to perform computer vision analysis on the web through a user's webcam."},{"heading":"What's next for Smart Dance 🚀","content":"A lot of dances are paired with famous songs.

NFTs are secure, protected, and traded via blockchain (Ethereum or other cryptocurrency) and can be purchased and resold via marketplaces. It's a rapidly growing sector, generating $2.5 billion+ this year, up from $13 million last year. NFTs are unique in the sense that every token can easily be authenticated and so fraudulent purchases and copied files are easily verified for the user. NFTs also bridge many different communities together. Some of them being artists, cryptocurrency enthusiasts, collectors, and normal people! It's a new way to financially support artists and for digital works to be verified as original copies - just like a Van Goh artwork would have a certificate of authentication with it. Even Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, sold his very first tweet as an NFT for $2.9 million!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our team had never worked with blockchain or computer vision, which made developing a project dependent on both a challenge.

Following this scepticism, the world saw disturbing riots taking place at the nations capital. With countries around the world becoming more divided, we ultimately trust one another less and less—especially when coming to counting ballots. Furthermore, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, people are more fearful of leaving their homes. With the upcoming Canadian election, many Canadians are forced to risk their health and safety just to exercise their basic voting rights. This why we created DiVA (Decentralized intelligent Voting Application), a decentralized voting system which uses blockchain technology to store ballots, while allowing users to cast their ballot using SMS messaging."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"DiVA is a decentralized voting system which uses blockchain technology to store ballots, while allowing users to cast their ballot using SMS messaging. Everything starts with a message to DiVA's central phone number. DiVA then sends the user a link to authenticate them selves. Authentication starts by validating the user is a real person using facial recognition technology for anti-spoofing detection. Then, they undergo an identity validation system powered by Azure Cognitive solutions, by taking a photo of themselves as well as of their Government issued photo ID. If verified, they then get another SMS message with a list of potential candidates to choose from. Final step is to send their choice back to the block chain along with their phone number. This information then gets added as one block on the block chain."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We build the blockchain using Solidity's smart contracts where each election is a new smart contract on the blockchain and each vote updates the contracts state on the blockchain. To test the blockchain we used Ganache and Truffle which emulates the Ethereum network locally.\n\nThe user verification is done by leveraging Mediapipe solutions for liveliness verification of eye blinking as well as using Azure's face verification API for face matching for identification and validation.\n\nThe web-application is made using a Flask/Python backend which connects to the blockchain using Web3.py and can create new elections, add candidates, cast votes for verified voters, show results and show all ballots casted with hashed userIDs for privacy so each ballot is anonymous but anyone can recount the ballots themselves."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of our most difficult challenges was coming up with a secure verification system that integrated with Twilio's API.

DiVA's main purpose was to be used in an election system. However, DiVA has the potential to be used in many different areas. In recent years we have seen more attention towards ensuring everyones voice is heard and that we engage in processes which promote equality. With DiVA, we are able to offer a platform for groups people to share their thoughts and ideas in an impactful way, while ensuring their voice is heard.

Most back-end services inherently have state while they are running, and so server migration is always a challenge (reboot).

This is not a simple container deployment! Paracrates dumps the memory of a running process to migrate the application and its state live over the network. Once transferred to the destination computer, we can instantly restore the application's state from the dumped memory!\n\nIn our demo, we used a Minecraft server as the application slingshotted. We start the server on one computer, joined it, and then transferred it to another computer in real time, without disconnecting the users! Seemingly a simple demo, there are many moving parts in order to accomplish live, seamless, instant transfer of an entire running program (skipping the boot up sequence, restoring directly to the state of the previous machine)."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"There are several significant moving parts that come together to bring the flow of Paracrates.\n\nElectron + React (Client Application) CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace) Docker Go (Transparent TCP Failover Proxy) NodeJS (Backend Microservice, running as a Websocket gateway) CockroachDB (database and microservice sync streaming server)\n\nThe user interface is a desktop application written using React and Electron. This client app is responsible both for the user-facing interface (login/register, selecting processes, destination users, etc), and also for orchestrating the application transfer and receive process behind the scenes (NodeJS side of Electron). The heart of the transfer process is CRIU (Checkpoint/Restore In Userspace). CRIU works by freezing the target process (similar to how a debugger works), dumping its memory, file descriptors, TCP socket states, and more. Any process can be dumped into a handful of files describing its current running state.\n\nThe application environments are inside Docker containers, allowing a consistent file system layout and OS environment for the target process. CRIU saves the running memory state of the application, while Docker saves the files.\n\nWe created a quick transparent TCP failover proxy in Go, used in our demo, to redirect network traffic as soon as the Minecraft server transfer completes, without any disconnects noticed by Minecraft clients.\n\nThe backend side of Paracrates was designed as a scaleable microservice, written in NodeJS. It is a websocket gateway that the clients connect to, and are able to send and receive messages (authentication requests, \"Crate\" push requests, etc). Why not REST? The real-time nature of Paracrates means Websockets are much more of an efficient choice. CockroachDB was our database of choice here for data storage, and its scaleable nature lends perfectly to our backend design. But we didn't just leverage its standard SQL capabilities, we were able to use it for much more...\n\nBecause the backend is designed to be deployed as a swarm and cluster, we needed a mechanism to synchronize the state between instances of the backend (because clients maintain a single stateful connection to a given backend server). This is where we made use of CockroachDB Changefeeds . Changefeeds allow clients to subscribe to a JSON stream of table changes. This means we can efficiently communicate state changes across the entire backend swarm/cluster through CockroachDB. Specifically, we insert a row into a \"changes\" table every time a client does an action through the backend. This means we both have logs of actions (for data analysis, very useful!), and so that every node in the cluster will be given an event to keep track of users across the entire network."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The documentation of CRIU is quite scarce, as it is quite obscure and has a small userbase. We spent much of the time debugging various limitations of CRIU, especially with restoring live TCP sockets and their source IPs. We ended up having to get around this by using failover proxies on each machine, that would emulate remote connections as local ones.\n\nWe also ran into issues with the environment between the source and destination, as they had to maintain the same file structure (for restoring the address space) and package dependencies. We ended up using Docker in order to maintain the system environment, along with its experimental integration with CRIU for checkpointing and restoring containers.\n\nWe had issues with getting the demo working with the live Minecraft server migration in particular. This was due to inherent limitations of the Minecraft client that caused it to time out during the dump and restore process. We used our failover proxy to provide a single \"server\" for clients which routed traffic as soon as the migration was complete.\n\nWe decided to self-host our backend and CockroachDB on a Raspberry Pi (for a number of reasons, mostly to demonstrate that the backend can fit on small edge nodes and scale up). However, this did prove challenging for CockroachDB, since there aren't any ARM64 builds available from Cockroach themselves. Short of having to compile the DB from scratch, we luckily found a Docker image with compiled binaries of ARM64 CockroachDB. This did have some disadvantages, namely we weren't able to use Enterprise changefeeds, and instead had to use the core changefeeds (which mean we could only stream using the sql cli, not a sink like Kafka), though this wasn't a huge issue for our design.\n\nFun fact: One of our team members forgot their laptop. Luckily, they didn't forget to bring a 2006 Dell Optiplex 755, with a whopping 2 cores and 6GB of RAM!! Our first few hours of the hackathon was trying to debug defective memory sticks and graphics drivers (as our team member forgot to add a graphics card and had to find one)."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are pretty proud that we were able to pull together so many pieces to accomplish the vision we set out. In particular, getting CRIU to work properly probably took most of our time, and was really the single most important component to the entire project. The most exciting moment would be when we got the entire live migration demo working late Saturday night, after so many setbacks and debugging mind-meltingly obscure issues.\n\nWe are also proud of the backend architecture. The websockets gateway proved fast and reliable, and our use of CockroachDB (incl. changefeeds) made it surprisingly scaleable (especially given the speed of development, usually it would be quite difficult).\n\nOh, and the entire backend stack is running on (and fit on) this tiny little happy Pi :)"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned a lot about the details of how processes run on Linux when dealing with CRIU, from how files are accessed, networking, user permissions, and the address space. We also learned more about networking in general, as we had to figure out how to proxy Minecraft clients to different remotes without interruption.\n\nOn the microservice side, we used CockroachDB for the first time and learned how to incorporate it.

Two rows of offset unidirectional latches alternate, powered by servos, allowing the plunger downwards to push the syfinge. Afterwards, another servo closes the cutter, separating the portion from the rest of the filling.\n\nClamping the Dumplings: The lazy susan on a bearing is turned to the correct position using a stepper motor connected to a pulley and string. The lazy susan has six 3 inch holes where a dumpling clamper is mounted. After the area with the meat dispenser, the lazy susan is turned where 2 rack and pinion mechanisms are pushed up to close the dumpling clamps. The original design for the dumpling clamps allowed the dumpling to fall out the bottom after being completed into the ladle, however due to lack of planning the ladle did not fit into the correct position.\n\nBoiling the Dumplings: A wire mesh ladle that has theoretically collected the dumplings is pulled into a pot of hot water using another stepper connected to a string pulley.

There is a catch, however. The effects of your actions are reflected on the map of your partner, not yours! Every block placed and bomb detonated will cause blocks to be destroyed or created on your partner's map, helping (or mostly, inhibiting) them from reaching the coveted gold star.\n\nEnjoy writhing in agony as your partner places a block 2 pixels too high, forcing you to start the level from scratch. Treasure the moment where your partner sets off the only bomb they had mid-air, destroying nothing but your will to continue playing this stupid game. BlowItUp features 15 exciting levels that challenge your problem-solving skills, spatial reasoning, and most importantly, patience to attempt the same level over and over again."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"BlowItUp is made with Phaser, a HTML5 game framework with a simple in-built physics engine. Aside from the Phaser framework, the game was implemented with pure JavaScript, with the API queries to the backend handled by jQuery.\n\nThe backend involved a traditional PHP server with a MySQL database that stored information about each room and facilitated the transmission of game data, such as player movements and actions that had to be transmitted for the specific effect (creating or destroying blocks) to occur for the other player as intended. The use of a lightweight PHP script and optimized queries to a MySQL database allowed for improved performance, which was important as the players' positions had to be fetched frequently during the course of the game."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Drawing sprites was a first for us as none of us had any design experience (or much game development experience, for that matter). As such, we decided to go with pixel art as it was the easiest to draw without any talent whatsoever.

This was resolved by using lightweight code and libraries as much as possible and by keeping performance in mind when structuring our database. For example, instead of repeatedly querying a large table for new information, we kept a separate table that recorded rooms with new updates and only queried the larger table in case there was an update to the game state of the specific room."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Actually completing level 14 of our game - we almost got a noise complaint cheering at 2am when that happened.\n\nAddendum: Things we are not proud of\n\nNot completing level 15.

When taken to the homepage for the first time, users can upload a PDF document that will pop up on the page. From there, they can either stick with the normal, mundane controls of how PDF navigation works nowadays--clicking buttons or specifying a specific page-- OR use the unique features our application provides! Our primary feature allows the user to flip the document by simply using a head or hand gesture in the direction they want to turn the page; the platform will use your camera and a machine learning algorithm that detects in real-time when gestures are made. Another feature involves the user speaking a specific word that will turn the document page for them; for instance, to turn to the next page, users can say \"next\" or \"right,\" and a speech recognition library will recognize their words and do the deed for them!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The user interface is built with React, and our machine learning model was trained using Tensorflow and is based on the pre-trained Movenet model.

However, to go into more detail, the main struggle for us was ensuring that our platform's video footage was properly being relayed to our ML model in real-time. It was quite a hassle working with React hooks, backend requests, and asynchronous (async-await) functions to get our scripts to recognize the real-time video footage, let alone even the component itself since it would render after the scripts were running. Changing up our ML model's dimensions and matrix calculations to pair with the data the video footage provided was also something puzzling that kept us going at night; oftentimes, the dimensionalities of our data and matrices just wouldn't match up. We faced other lesser issues, but nothing compared to the gruesomeness of full-stacking everything together."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Despite all of the bugs and struggles that tried to let us down, we persevered and finished with a product that we were all proud of. All of the main features we initially brainstormed for this project were successfully implemented, and we even had time to come up with a few minor features nearing the end of our hacking time (e.g. the normal controls of PDF navigation) to add icing on the top!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned that neural networks are surprisingly effective at what they do--we did not expect them to correctly identify certain positions from pose data (the positions of the user’s ears, chin, etc.) on the first try, but they worked like magic. In addition, it is more difficult than it may first seem to ensure interoperability among different modules in a software project."},{"heading":"What's next for AirFlip","content":"Our future mission is to improve two aspects of our project: the architecture and the model. Our project is still in the MVP stage and the neural network, despite its decent performance, could still use some improvement, while the architecture of the project still needs improvements. The next step for the neural network would be to migrate into a production-level model using industry tools like TensorFlow or PyTorch to ensure maintainability, evolvability, and scalability. In terms of architecture, our goal is to improve our state management."},{"heading":"Business Viability","content":"This idea has lots of potential to turn into a successful tech venture. One route we could go is to turn our project into a document-editing and storage platform like Google Drive or PDF-editing tools with an incredibly unique toolset of ML-based features. Machine learning in document platforms can be used in a variety of ways, not just for gesture detection and speech recognition for navigation but also (as an example) for sorting files using unsupervised learning. A source of revenue for this idea would be to incorporate pricing plans, with more plans offering more extensive sets of features like more storage and better ML performance. Another potential route for this project is to turn it into a tech platform that helps automate any mundane task like scrolling through a PDF using ML, more specifically gesture detection and speech recognition. Again, our main source of revenue would most likely come in the form of pricing plans that offer more robust features as you climb in price. Near the end of the hackathon, our team realized that gesture detection and speech recognition have countless uses outside of our app, especially with regards to making services more accessible to everyone. No matter which route we follow, AirFlip will bring a significant impact to the world."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css3 firebase html5 javascript json ola python react speechapi tensorflow tfjs"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com ericxiao.tech"}]},{"project_title":"SNKRView","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/snkrview","tagline":"The ultimate fashion tool","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/660/731/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2021","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2021.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Supercharge your Apps with EdgeML using Rune"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"colab","url":null},{"name":"rune","url":null},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null},{"name":"xcode","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/gaurabacharya/SnkrView"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We all tell a story with our clothing.

Most importantly, it also tells them where they need to improve and actionable advice. Additionally, it shows how closely their presence aligned with their intention.\n\nConvey is super easy to use and essentially trains you to drastically improve on something you already do every day!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started with sticks and stones - well almost at least. It began with using Google Colab and sentiment analysis data to train a Bert-Transformer model. Now we’re newbies when it came to PyTorch and Attention mechanisms, but we eventually got a working model that could detect the tone! We hooked it up with countless packages to record audio, transcribe it into text. feed it into the model --> and it worked!\n\nBut that was only the start. We wanted to go bigger! Infrastructure! Connecting to users! Long-term storage of Metrics! Capability to scale up! Reinforce habits through text messages! We noticed 3 sponsors that could help us out: Google Cloud, Cockroachdb, and Twilio!\n\nSo now the process goes like this: Data is recorded during Google Meet / Zoom --> This is sent to Google Cloud Storage. Using Google Speech to Text we transcribe the audio into a text format. Now we take the mp3 audio and text and put it into the ML Model (which was re-trained on Google Cloud). This outputs the sentiment analysis, which is sent back to the user, and sent to Cockroachdb for long-term storage. Through Twilio’s API we send text messages to the users to remind them throughout the day on how to improve, acting as their own digital personal assistant."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This hackathon was filled with many challenges - we purposely choose an ML area where we didn't know too much in (NLP, Attention, PyTorch), which was a challenging and humbling experience. In addition to that, we choose to somewhat restart our project and move everything to the sponsor's side. We had never played with Google Cloud, Cockroach DB SQL, or Servers before so it was an interesting learning experience! This proved to be a great decision after seeing all of the powerful tools and features they included. We made it somewhat purposefully challenging for ourselves because we wanted to maximize our learning."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're really proud of being able to step up to the challenges and be able to use so many new areas of ML (NLP, Attention, PyTorch) and SWE tools (Google Cloud, Cockroach DB, and Twilio).

We kept preaching that done was better than perfect to keep the flow going and to our surprise, it kept us captivated by the problem we were trying to solve and everything from the design to the actual code itself! The biggest thing for us was to keep moving forward and we'll be taking that mantra with us into the next competition!"},{"heading":"What's next for Convey","content":"We want Convey to empower future leaders, entrepreneurs, and founders on their journey to become the best presenters they can be. We don't have to imagine a system that helps us identify our presentation pitfalls in real-time, we have that! We hope the extension will be used far and wide to improve the flow of speakers everywhere and help them gain confidence in their abilities."},{"heading":"Business Viability","content":"We aim for Convey to have two separate plans: a free Basic version and a paid Premium version. The Basic version contains speech-to-text software that analyzes your tone, pacing, clarity, pausing and progress over time. For a small monthly fee, the Premium version gets you more advanced features like analyzing the number of filler words you used and providing detailed feedback on your presence (enthusiasm and confidence over the duration of the call) in addition to all the Basic features.\n\nEffective communication is something we all need, but in terms of tools, this is pretty much an untapped market. There are a few apps on the market that make users do specific and often tedious vocal exercises and give critique. These have amassed a small but loyal user base, acting as proof of concept for Convey.\n\nNow think if a tool could integrate into a user’s actual life in real-time, helping them convey ideas a little bit better with every meeting. Imagine Grammarly, but for speech - there's no product on the market like this.\n\nYour voice is solely unique to you, and it’s an asset we believe people should be able to train and improve … so that anyone can convey with confidence!"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroachlabs googlecloudproducts natural-language-processing python pytorch twilio"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Sharity","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/sharity-lmai6z","tagline":"Helping the homeless through aggregating and gamifying community involvement!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/658/270/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2021","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2021.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Microsoft's Best use of Cloud for Social Good"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"azure-power-platform","url":null},{"name":"bing-maps","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bing-maps"},{"name":"cloud-service","url":null},{"name":"power-app","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/xinyizou/Sharity"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/emichelle-teh/msapp-sharity-v2"},{"label":"www.figma.com","url":"https://www.figma.com/file/KsszU9V1LOZiqkJEpNosd0/Trial-with-Annie?node-id=0%3A1"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration 💡","content":"Making our way in downtown Toronto, it's so easy for us to see so many homeless people uncared for.

This is where Hive-HQ comes in – it is an AI-powered, multi-target tracking system that identifies common hotspots and bottlenecks where people crowd together in unsafe situations. We set out to build a tool to help businesses monitor their premises and prevent the spread of COVID-19, creating a safer world for everyone."},{"heading":"❓ What it does","content":"Hive-HQ is a full suite of enterprise management tools used to monitor and improve a location’s safety with reference to COVID-19 guidelines. Based on a user-provided floor plan and data processed from security cameras, it presents live statistics of the number of people in a given store or public area, creates a heat map of foot traffic within a certain area, and provides recommendations based on said heat map to improve customer flow. There is functionality to add, remove, and configure any number of cameras in the system.\n\nThe live heat map displays the current number of customers throughout a location using a gradient coloured scale to indicate how dangerous a given situation potentially may be (blue meaning safe to red meaning unsafe). Based on this heatmap, a business can generate and implement customized recommendations that change the layout of the area (tables, displays, etc.) in order to improve circulation and eliminate bottlenecks and regions that see many customers passing through. By providing tools to help enterprises evaluate and improve the health safety of their physical locations, Hive-HQ is building safer environments for businesses and their customers."},{"heading":"💼 Business viability","content":"Hive-HQ builds on top of existing infrastructure. Security cameras around an environment are perfect for this application. This means there’s little to no upfront cost to deploy this solution. We also leverage cloud computing, allowing for deployment everywhere and for even low-power devices, such as laptops, Chromebooks, and phones, to utilize our app. Most importantly, Hive-HQ gathers essential data that many clients would desire. Concentrations on the heatmap are able to reveal where people tend to gather, the popularity of a product or display, and possible improvements to the layout of a store to be more “COVID safe”.\n\nOur vision for a user-friendly and easily-implemented service that monitors and provides important information about a given environment and its COVID-19 risk. This vision is unique and has a clear direction, with few if any current competitors in the market. And our concept for such a service comes at the right time. As society and the economy reopen, and as more consumers are engaging with businesses' physical locations, it is more important than ever to ensure that case counts remain low and that everyone stays safe. Our model, currently focused on potential applications for COVID-19, can also be easily reconfigured to maximize success in a post-COVID world. For example, Hive-HQ may be used to determine the success of a product or marketing campaign based on the number of consumers that have gathered or passed through a certain area. Overall, Hive-HQ is highly viable as a business model, with a unique identity, clear relevance for our time, and the potential for tremendous impact."},{"heading":"🧰 How we built it","content":"YOLOv5: A brand new advanced AI architecture used to identify and track people within the camera streams.

The backend server was built using the Express.js framework running in Node, and it is responsible for features such as handling transaction requests from the app, as well as connecting to the Exercoin blockchain to make transactions. Finally, we used Ganache to create the Exercoin blockchain. It runs on the Ethereum ERC20 standard and stores both the balances of each user wallet, as well as an archive of all past transactions. All of the Exercoin in circulation is initially held in one master wallet. As users take more steps, transactions are made to their personal wallets, and blocks representing these transactions are added to the blockchain for safekeeping.

Once the game is started, each player will have a turn to respond to a prompt, after which their response is revealed to the room and our algorithm calculates the player's score based on how much the others were laughing.
