Their flight and hotel would be chosen and booked for them based off the optimal algorithm as well as their preferences, saving money for the company.\n\nIn addition, they would no longer have to book their own flights, saving them time booking and filling out expense reports. When asked, most HackIllinois attendees in the workforce would not mind having their flights and hotels booked for them if their preferences were taken into consideration. For example: only fly American Airlines, prefer to fly mornings, prefer least travel time, have travel rewards number (can be inputted)."},{"heading":"Business case","content":"Is this really saving enough money to be worth using? To find this out, we gathered information on a few companies that HackIllinois workplace attendees worked for or had worked for in the past.\n\nCompany A : ~100,000 employees, ~100 people per team ~1000 teams spread across different office locations, 1-2 team summits per team per year\n\n1.5 team summits * 1000 teams * 100 people getting moved * AMOUNT_SAVED_PER_PERSON = 150,000 * AMOUNT_SAVED_PER_PERSON\n\nLet's say we can save ~$50/person.\n\n150,000 * 50 = $7,500,000 in savings/year.\n\nRealistically, Company A is doing well enough financially that $7,500,000 is going to make or break them. Let's try another company\n\nCompany B : ~300 employees, ~10-20 people per team, ~20 teams, 1-2 team meetings per team per year\n\n1.5 meetings * 20 teams * 15 people getting moved * AMOUNT_SAVED_PER_PERSON = 450 * AMOUNT_SAVED_PER_PERSON\n\nLet's say we can save ~$50/person.\n\n$450 * 50 = $225,000 in savings/year\n\nSo we can see that in a smaller company, this could be a non-negligible portion of the budget allowed for travel."},{"heading":"Open source use cases","content":"This software would ideally be full-featured with expense management and other travel planning features that our competitors like SAP Concur, Egencia, or Certify to have a leg up on the competitors.\n\nHowever , we noticed a potential use for our algorithms in many domains. Any instance of a group of people all on one budget needing to meet in a place could send in their parameters to our algorithms and find out their total cost as well as the optimal place to meet. For example: a NFL sports team reunion."},{"heading":"Understanding the algorithm","content":"We use a min-cost max-flow problem to solve this problem. This problem finds the max units that can be moved from a source to a dest while getting the smallest cost as well as takes in capacity. Our concern with moving large amounts of people from place to place is that there is limited space on flights, so we knew any algorithm we could come up with would try to put everyone on the same, cheapest flight to a location even if that space is not available. We modeled this graph and sent it in to a library that black boxed this problem for us.\n\nOne mistake we made was thinking we could force all the flow through one airport destination (in this case, AUS or SFO). We realize that the algorithm does not work if the total flow is not 0, which made this impossible to put a -500 flow on each of these locations to get all the people to end up in the same place.\n\nRealizing this too late, our algorithm is modified in a small way. We instead take the location that the most people are sent to as the optimal location as it is saving them the most money and would likely be overall optimal.\n\nIn the future, we would revamp our algorithm to be optimal."},{"heading":"Usage","content":"npm install on both server and client\n\nnpm start on both server and client\n\nAlgorithm for free use in server/cost_optimizer.py"},{"heading":"License","content":"MIT License Copyright (c) 2019 Michael Shea Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions: The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Google Maps and its API currently bring in ~$2 billion in revenue, and are projected to bring in ~$5 billion by 2020. They've also been steadily increasing their prices, which has made many businesses look for alternatives. Many have looked to OpenStreetMap, but as stated previously, many rural and suburban areas remain unmapped due to the difficulty/tediousness of doing so. Our product allows users to map roughly 15x faster, and we plan to contact the OpenStreetMap foundation to work with them to officially implement it. Ideally, this will result in a far more robust map and draw even more businesses to use it over the costly alternatives."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ajax css flask html javascript mapbox opencv openstreetmap python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com drive.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"Parcel","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/wasm-hot-loading-for-parcel","tagline":"Web Assembly hot module reloading for Parcel","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/769/929/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackIllinois 2019","hackathon_url":"https://hackillinois2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"parcel","url":null},{"name":"rust","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/rust"},{"name":"webassembly","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/bencooper222/parcel"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Hot-reloading has been a huge productivity boost to projects like React and other front-end tools, but with Web Assembly, it has been a challenge to enable live changes to be propagated to the browser due to a compile step from a non-JS language (eg. Go or Rust). We hoped to get it to work with zero configuration on the part of the user, via the Parcel bundler."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The project enables Web Assembly to be hot-reloaded in the browser on file change, for the Parcel bundler. In practical terms, whenever a project file changes (eg. a Rust project), the browser will automatically reflect this change without needing a page reload , theoretically allowing state to be preserved. This is a significant development improvement from the current ability of Parcel, which only shows changes on each page reload."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust, in order to rewrite portions of the Parcel bundler in order to support hot-reload on file change. We also built a sample project in Rust to demonstrate this capability. A lot of work was put into analyzing how Parcel's Web Assembly build pipeline currently works, so that we could enhance it - we made parts of it asynchronous, as well as made other modifications in order to enable it to support other types of static files (SVGs, etc.) to be hot-reloaded in the future."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Parcel's code base is massive, and due to its young age, has much less documentation than other more mature build tools. A lot of approaches we looked into simply required changing too much of the code base that wasn't originally built to support Web Assembly originally. Due to its zero-config approach, adding features often required changing a lot of internal code, so we tried to strike a balance of not rewriting too much versus adding functionality and generalizing where it made sense to."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We got the Rust project to be hot-reloaded!!!!!!! This is the first time I've seen Web Assembly be hot-reloaded in the browser working out-of-the-box, with zero configuration beforehand on the part of the user."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Over the course of this weekend, our team has learned a lot of the internals of how Parcel works. We've explored how the Rust compiler gets called, how bundles are hashed differently in production and development, how caching refreshes work, which processes get called on each refresh and update, and so much more. We've also learned a lot about the challenges of Web Assembly and its limits compared to other traditional assets."},{"heading":"What's next for WASM hot-loading for Parcel","content":"The next step would be to be able to support other static file types, and improving incremental build performance, perhaps via more intelligent caching, and better tree traversal to hot-reload the minimal number of modules on each change."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"javascript parcel rust webassembly"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"NurseNet","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/nursenet-cfibn8","tagline":"A mapping algorithm utilizing machine learning to optimize nurse home visits through clusters of similar patients.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/770/092/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackIllinois 2019","hackathon_url":"https://hackillinois2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Dive Into Healthcare Presented by Optum"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"excel","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/excel"},{"name":"google-maps","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps"},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"scikit-learn","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/cbguo2/HackIllionois2019Optum"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/cbguo2/HackIllionois2019Optum/tree/GoogleMapAPIImplementation"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Working smarter not harder.
