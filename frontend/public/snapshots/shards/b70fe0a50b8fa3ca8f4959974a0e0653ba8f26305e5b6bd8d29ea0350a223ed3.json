Take a snap. Our AI-powered app identifies the catch, keeps track of stats, and puts that fish in your 3d, virtual, interactive aquarium! Simply click on any fish in your aquarium, and all its details — its rarity, location, and more — appear, bringing your fishing memories back to life. Also, depending on the fish you catch, reel in achievements, such as your first fish caught (ever!), or your first 20 incher. The cherry on top? All users’ catches are displayed on an interactive map (built with Leaflet), where you can discover new fishing spots, or plan to get your next big catch :)\n\nInspiration\n\nOur journey began with a simple observation: while fishing creates lasting memories, capturing those moments often falls short. We realized that a picture might be worth a thousand words, but a well-told fish tale is priceless. This spark ignited our mission to blend the age-old art of fishing with cutting-edge AI technology.\n\nWhat We Learned\n\nDiving into this project was like casting into uncharted waters – exhilarating and full of surprises. We expanded our skills in:\n\nIntegrating AI models (Google's Gemini LLM) for image recognition and creative text generation Crafting seamless user experiences in React Building robust backend systems with Node.js and Express Managing data with MongoDB Atlas Creating immersive 3D environments using Three.js\n\nBut beyond the technical skills, we learned the art of transforming a simple idea into a full-fledged application that brings joy and preserves memories.\n\nHow We Built It\n\nOur development process was as meticulously planned as a fishing expedition:\n\nWe started by mapping out the user journey, from snapping a photo to exploring their virtual aquarium. The frontend was crafted in React, ensuring a responsive and intuitive interface. We leveraged Three.js to create an engaging 3D aquarium, bringing caught fish to life in a virtual environment. Our Node.js and Express backend became the sturdy boat, handling requests and managing data flow. MongoDB Atlas served as our net, capturing and storing each precious catch securely. The Gemini AI was our expert fishing guide, identifying species and spinning yarns about each catch.\n\nChallenges We Faced\n\nLike any fishing trip, we encountered our fair share of challenges:\n\nIntegrating Gemini AI : Ensuring accurate fish identification and generating coherent, engaging stories required fine-tuning and creative problem-solving. 3D Rendering : Creating a performant and visually appealing aquarium in Three.js pushed our graphics programming skills to the limit. Data Management : Structuring our database to efficiently store and retrieve diverse catch data presented unique challenges. User Experience : Balancing feature-rich functionality with an intuitive, streamlined interface was a constant tug-of-war.\n\nDespite these challenges, or perhaps because of them, our team grew stronger and more resourceful. Each obstacle overcome was like landing a prized catch, making the final product all the more rewarding.\n\nAs we cast our project out into the world, we're excited to see how it will evolve and grow, much like the tales of fishing adventures it's designed to capture."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"express.js gemini leaflet.js mongodb node.js react three.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"ChatGPMe","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/chatgpme","tagline":"The reason you should say 'please' and 'thank you' to your AI agents.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/026/301/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2024","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2024.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2024 Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"cohere","url":null},{"name":"defang","url":null},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"procreate","url":null},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/r-chong/HTN-2024/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"AI, AI, AI...","content":"The number of projects using LLMs has skyrocketed with the wave of artificial intelligence.

For this central LLM, we offer two options: Cohere and Groq. Our default model is the Cohere LLM, which using its integrated RAG and preamble capability offers superior accuracy and a custom personality for our responses, providing more fun and engagement for the user. Our second option Groq though providing a lesser quality of a response, provides fast process times, a short coming of Cohere. Both of these LLM's are based on large meticulously defined prompts (characterizing from the output structure to the method of listing wires), which produce the results that are necessary in generating the final results seen by the user.\n\nIn order to provide the user with different forms of information, we decide to present electrical schematics on the webpage.

The combination of sensory losses means existing solutions, such as sign language for the deaf or speech transcription for the blind, cannot be used. As a result, over 160 million Deafblind people around the world are severely limited in their ability to communicate.\n\nCurrent solutions require uncomfortable physical contact or the presence of a 24/7 guide-communicator, preventing independence. These barriers to being able to freely explore and interact with your world can lead to you feeling isolated and alone."},{"heading":"🎯 OUR GOAL","content":"Our goal was to build a communication device that can help Deafblind persons understand and communicate with the world without invasive physical contact, a requirement for a volunteer communicator, or an inaccessible/impractical design.\n\n🔭 WHAT IS PERCEIV/IO?\n\nPERCEIV/IO is a novel hardware device powered by the latest AI advancements to help the Deafblind.\n\nWe designed PERCEIV/IO to have two main use-cases. First, used a camera to take periodic captures of the world in front of the user and use AI image-to-text technologies to translate it into braille, which is then displayed on a tactile hand-held device that we have fabricated. This can help a Deafblind person understand their surroundings, which is currently very limited in scope. Second, we designed a speech-to-braille system to help allow for communication with the Deafblind. We also incorporated sentiment analysis to effectively convey the tones of standard English phrases to make communication more robust. The specific details can be found in the next section.\n\nWe hope some of the ideas generated during this hackathon turn are able to be used in organizations such as CNIB Deafblind Community Services in order to help them with their goal of assisting people who need it most."},{"heading":"📣 FEATURES","content":"Get a description of the world in front of you translated into braille directly at your fingertips.

Each stepper motor controls an octagonal braille disc. Placing two of these side-by-side creates a full braille cell, with different stepper motor rotations producing different braille characters. We designed the Raspberry Pi code on Python and developed our own algorithim for converting text directly into stepper motor coordinates (position to display the correct braille character).\n\nSoftware\n\nWe used image recognition AI based on Groq using their Llava v1.5 image-to-text endpoint, and that text is then put through Groq 's Llama 3.1 70b endpoint to condense it down into just two or three words. We used Google Speech-to-Text and the Facebook RoBERTa base model for simple sentiment analysis with a Genesys -based sentiment analysis feature currently being deployed. We developed our own code to convert into Grade II Unified English Braille Code.\n\nOn the backend, our database is based on Convex along with our accompanying app. We also built a prototype, web-hosted app on the Streamlit platform integrated with hugging face ML models loaded through the transformers pipeline.\n\nWe facilitated wireless communication between the apps and the hardware through Github by running functions to update a file and check for updates on a file. We are also working on a Genesys based AI chat bot, the responses of which would be translated into braille and communicated to the user."},{"heading":"🌎 ENVIRONMENTALLY CONSCIOUS","content":"As users of AI during this boom of innovation over the last couple years, we strive to be as environmentally conscious as possible and be aware of the power we are consuming whenever we prompt an LLM. Over the course of a large model's first one million messages, it has an estimated power cost of 55.1Mwh . That's enough power to power roughly 120 American homes for a year!\n\nThankfully, with Groq , not only do we have access to lightning-fast response speeds, but due to their LPUs, SRAM, and sequential processing we are using less power than if we were to use the traditional NVIDIA counterpart. Conserving energy is very important to us, and we are thankful for Groq to providing a solution for us."},{"heading":"🧗‍♀️ CHALLENGES WE'VE OVERCOME","content":"Hackathons are about nothing if not overcoming challenges. Whenever a piece of hardware broke, software wouldn't cooperate, or motors wouldn't connect, we would work as a team to solve the issue and push on through. It ended up being a very rewarding experience for all of us.\n\nOne major challenge that's still fresh in my mind is our issues with the Raspberry Pi. We ended up going through three Pi's before we realized that none of their SD cards had any OS on them! Eventually, with the help of the amazing mentors here at Hack The North (thank you again Moody!), we we're able to get the SD card flashed and were able to start uploading our code. Thankfully, due to our adoption of SOLID principles and our policy of encapsulation, we were able to implement the code we has worked on in the meantime with ease.\n\nOur hardware issues didn't end there! After careful testing of almost every different software & hardware component to determine why our code was not working, we found that 2 stepper motor drivers were faulty. With the help of mentors, however, we got this resolved and we learned the painstakingly careful process of hardware verification!\n\nAnother problem was more to do with logic- turning an image into text is easy. Turning that text into braille, and then turning that braille into signals from a Raspberry Pi into 4 proprietary stepper motors that control half of a braille character each is whole other. Luckily with some wisdom from our team members with past experience with these kinds of electronics combined with some logic learned in hardware classes, we as a team were able to come up with the implementation to make it work."},{"heading":"🏆 WHAT WE'RE PROUD OF","content":"We are most proud of coming up with a novel idea that uses novel technology to help people in need. I think it is everyone's desire to develop something that is actually useful to other humans, especially while utilizing the latest technologies. We think that technology's greatest advantages are the advantages it is able to give to others in order to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nSome Specifics\n\nThe device our team members' relative would have to use costs upwards of $3000 USD ( link ). This is prohibitively expensive, especially given that many of the world's Deafblind come from underprivileged nations. The prototyping costs for our hardware were free, thanks to Hack the North. However, we estimate manufacturing costs to be under $100 given the low-cost hardware, making this system far more affordable.\n\nSecond, our system is novel in its comprehensive approach. Current solutions (such as the $3000 product) require a connection to an external computer to function. This means they cannot be used portably, thereby preventing a Deafblind person from being able to explore. Moreover, they do not integrate any of the image-to-braille or speech & sentiment-to-braille technologies, severely limiting their scope. We believe our project will substantially improve the status quo by allowing for these features. Our device is portable, can be used without additional peripherals, and integrates all necessary conversion technology.\n\nLastly, our prototype has two fully-functioning braille cells that follow the distance and format requirements of Grade II Braille . This means that our hardware is not just a proof of concept for a braille device, but could actually be implemented directly in Deafblind communities. Moreover, it is likely to be extremely efficient as the stepper motor design does not require individual motors for each braille pin, but rather just one motor for a whole column.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, though...\n\nWe are so proud of the fact that we came up with and created a working prototype for our idea within only 32 hours(!!!). For many of us, this was our first time working with hardware within such a short time frame, so learning the ins and outs of it enough to make a product is a huge accomplishment."},{"heading":"💡 WHAT DID WE LEARN?","content":"Over the course of this hackathon, we learned so much about the Deafblind community by reading online testimonials of those who have been diagnosed. It allowed us insight into a corner of the world that we had otherwise not known much about prior. Through developing our product while keeping these testimonials in mind, we also realized the difference between developing a product in order to beat others in a competition and developing a product because we believe this could actually be useful to real people one day.\n\nThe many sponsors here at Hack The North were also very valuable in teaching us about their product and how we can implement them into our product to improve it's functionality and efficiency. For example, Groq were very helpful in describing exactly why utilizing their API was more energy efficient than the big guys. We were super eager to learn about new technologies such as Symphonic labs, as we realized their use-case as an AI that can read lips was very applicable to our device."},{"heading":"🔜 THE FUTURE OF PERCEIV/IO","content":"We have thought long and hard about the future of PERCEIV/IO. We've already come up with a laundry list of ideas that we want to implement sometime in the future in order for this product to achieve it's full potential. The number one thing is to shrink the size of the actual hardware. Raspberry Pi's are extremely useful for prototyping- but are a bit too bulky for use in a commercial product. We want to achieve a size similar to a smart watch with similar processing power.\n\nWe also want to relocate the camera and have it wirelessly communicate with the computer. One idea was to embed the camera into a pair of sunglasses in a similar style to Spectacles by Snap Inc.\n\nAnd finally, we are waiting for the day where AI technology and hardware reaches a point where we can run all models locally, without the need for a massive power bank or network connection. That would truly untether the user from any external requirements for a real feeling of freedom.\n\n🪿 Thank you to all who showed interested in PERCEIV/IO, and a huge congratulations to all hackers who submitted in time.

We simulated the shopping experience in a store as well as interactable objects that can be tried on."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Linking a general C# script which makes REST API calls to Unity was a blocker for us because of the structure of code Unity works with. We needed to do some digging and search for what adjustments needed to be made to a generic program to make it suitable for the VR application. For example, including libraries such as Newtonsoft.\n\nWe also ran into conflicts when merging different branches of our project on GitHub. We needed to spend additional time rolling back changes and fixing bugs to take the next step in the project.\n\nOne significant difficulty was modelling the motion of the virtual arms and elbows when visible in the mirror. This must be done with inverse kinematics which we were never quite able to smoothly implement, although we achieved something somewhat close.\n\nGetting the collision boundaries was difficult as well. The player and their surroundings constantly change in VR, and it was a challenge to set the boundaries of item interaction for the player when putting on items."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our project has set a strong foundation for future enhancements.

Properly allocating time for troubleshooting unexpected challenges would have helped us manage our time more efficiently.\n\nAlso, many technical challenges required a trial-and-error approach, especially when setting up collision boundaries and working with avatar motion. This taught us that sometimes it's better to start with a rough solution and iteratively refine it, rather than trying to perfect everything on the first go.\n\nFinally, working as a team, we realized the value of maintaining clear communication, especially when multiple people are contributing to the same project. Whether it was assigning tasks or resolving GitHub conflicts, being aligned on priorities and maintaining good communication channels kept us moving forward."},{"heading":"What's next for Shop The North","content":"We want to add even more variety for future users. We hope to develop more types of clothing, such as shoes and hats, as well as character models that could suit any body type for an inclusive experience. Additionally, we would like to implement a full transaction system, where the user can add all the products they are interested into a cart and complete a full order (payment information, shipping details, and actually placing a real order). In general, the goal would be to have everything a mobile/web online shopping app has, and more fun features on top of it."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"c# github json oculus-gear-vr shopify unity"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Hack the Bomb","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/hack-the-bomb","tagline":"Hackathons aren't always about improving the world.

It focuses highly on accessibility."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"On the software side , we made extensive use of VoiceFlow and Mappedin. This provided a significant challenge since these services could not efficiently be run on a Raspberry Pi, so we created a mobile-friendly web application that takes care of human-computer interaction (text to speech, speech to text) as well as making API requests.\n\nWe used a custom knowledge base on VoiceFlow to customize the agent to be very specific to the different rooms in E7 and point of interests at Hack the North. We used VoiceFlow's Supabase integration to log a request in the database to begin a trip in the database (that the Raspberry Pi picks up on). Through the app, we made calls to VoiceFlow's API to progress the user's conversation with the agent.\n\nFor Mappedin, we rendered the map on a React Typescript application and made use of the Wayfinding endpoint to retrieve thorough directions. Not only are these directions displayed on the app, but they are sent to the Supabase database which the Raspberry Pi listens to for entries to trigger certain movements.\n\nSupabase was used to connect the Raspberry Pi, VoiceFlow Agent, and Mappedin wayfinding. We chose Supabase due to its realtime subscription abilities and also its compatibility with all three ends of Rex.\n\nOn the firmware side , our hardware system involved multiple sensors and actuators such as a Gyroscope, accelerometer, ultra-sonic sensor, and 4 DC motors. Challenged with not having access to a GPS or motor encoders, we used the accelerometer to determine our current location with respect to the origin when navigating through some area, and used the Gyroscope to feed data into our PID controller to ensure we can travel straight and make accurate turns. We also used an ultra-sonic sensor for obstacle avoidance. Once we have received the directions to the requested destination from the database, we use these sensors and actuators to ensure you are able to get there safely.\n\nOn the mechanical side , the dog-shaped cover, axles, and ears for this project were 3D printed. The cover was designed to resemble a Dachshund, serving as a protective casing for the wheels, MCU, and circuit components. Two axles were fabricated to hold the assembly together, with the lower axle specifically supporting the main microcontroller. One of the main challenges we encountered was the placement of the battery pack inside the dog’s head, which affected the balance. To counteract this, we added another axle vertically, connecting the base to the top of the robot dog to maintain stability."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into many significant challenges primarily in the realm of interfacing between all the different services and especially the fact that we had to package everything into a Raspberry Pi with real-world movement. We had to leverage a cloud database to communicate with all the different end devices. Moreover, not having a GPS receiver made us look at other solutions to maintain accuracy during movement. Lastly, some APIs didn't have support in certain languages which forced us to be creative with our implementations."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of the way we were able to interconnect all these systems and put it into a compelling form factor.

Any location covered by the Wi-Fi network will allow the cane to connect to the webpage, enabling long-range data communication.

The ESP also calls the Google Cloud Geolocation API to triangulate its latitude and longitude based on other Wi-Fi devices on the network.\n\nThe react webpage receives and displays all raw data, along with a MappedIn map of E7. The map is updated with the latitude and longitude of the cane only when a fall is detected, and a path is drawn from a dedicated medical zone to the incident location.

This table is queried in a scheduled job to aggregate the day’s brainbeat data which is stored in a separate table for analytics and insights. The job is run everyday at 12am for the previous day’s data. This process allows for more optimized retrievals of the aggregated insights on user request.

That's where GenomIQ comes in. I wanted to create a tool that lets anyone – yes, even you – play around with editing plasmids and dive into genetic engineering.

Verification is performed by a local instance of Alphafold 2, which based on the provided DNA sequence will give you a structure file. I found a website that implements Prosa, a scoring metric for proteins, and built a web scrapper/bot that uploads your structure file and gathers the z-score from there. The plasmid viewer is a canvas that is updated whenever a route returns new features.\n\nThe repo also includes a file for a short fine tuning dataset builder tool with a GUI, that I put together to make it easier to fine tune my model.\n\nI developed a benchmark set and performed an evaluation of the standard cohere model vs the fine tuned model, and compared their z-score across.

Conversation with Aligned Voice: This core feature was powered by Groq, users engage in a live conversation that feels as natural as talking to a real person. We used Groq's integrations with Whisper for speech to text - then sent this info to our backend server for stateless requests to Groq's blazing fast llama 3 models. We experimented with various platforms but found Groq to give us the latency necessary for our needs Personality Embedding: This was the bread and butter of our app. The conversation data is processed by Cohere's Embed API to generate a personality embedding, which is stored in Chroma DB vector database. Matchmaking: Users can then search for others with similar profiles using vector similarity algorithms. This was all ran over Chroma DB's seamless and powerful interface with multiple integrations. Summaries of similarities are hosted using Groq and Cohere. The system ranks matches from most to least aligned, providing a curated list of potential connections. Reach Out: Once a match is found, users can reach out directly using the embedded social information."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the main challenges we faced was prompt engineering—ensuring that the AI could generate meaningful and accurate personality embeddings from the conversations.

Whether you've encountered them on your way to class, been woken up by honking at 7 am, or spent your days trying to bypass flocks of geese during nesting season, the geese have established themselves as a central fixture of the Waterloo campus. How can we turn the staple bird of the university into a asset? Inspired by the quintessential role the geese play in campus life, we built an app to integrate our feather friends into our academic lives. Our app, Goose on the Loose allows you to take pictures of geese around the campus and turn them into your study buddies! Instead of being intimidated by the fowl fowl, we can now all be friends!"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Goose on the Loose allows the user to \"capture\" geese across the Waterloo campus and beyond by snapping a photo using their phone camera. If there is a goose in the image, it is uniquely converted into a sprite added to the player's collection. Each goose has its own student profile and midterm grade. The more geese in a player's collection, the higher each goose's final grade becomes, as they are all study buddies who help one another. The home page also contains a map where the player can see their own location, as well as locations of nearby goose sightings."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"This project is made using Next.js with Typescript and TailwindCSS. The frontend was designed using Typescript React components and styled with TailwindCSS. MongoDB Atlas was used to store various data across our app, such as goose data and map data. We used the @React Google Maps library to integrate the Google maps display into our app. The player's location data is retrieved from the browser. Cohere was used to help generate names and quotations assigned to each goose. OpenAI was used for goose identification as well as converting the physical geese into sprites. All in all, we used a variety of different technologies to power our app, many of which we were beginners to."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We were very unfamiliar with Cohere and found ourselves struggling to use some of its generative AI technologies at first. After playing around with it for a bit, we were able to get it to do what we wanted, and this saved us a lot of head pain.\n\nAnother major challenge we underwent was getting the camera window to display properly on a smartphone. While it worked completely fine on computer, only a fraction of the window would be able to display on the phone and this really harmed the user experience in our app. After hours of struggle, debugging, and thinking, we were able to fix this problem and now our camera window is very functional and polished.\n\nOne severely unexpected challenge we went through was one of our computers' files corrupting. This caused us HOURS of headache and we spent a lot of effort in trying to identify and rectify this problem. What made this problem worse was that we were at first using Microsoft VS Code Live Share with that computer happening to be the host. This was a major setback in our initial development timeline and we were absolutely relieved to figure out and finally solve this problem.\n\nA last minute issue that we discovered had to do with our Cohere API. Since the prompt did not always generate a response within the required bounds, looped it until it landed in the requirements. We fixed this by setting a max limit on the amount of tokens that could be used per response.\n\nOne final issue that we ran into was the Google Maps API. For some reason, we kept running into a problem where the map would force its centre to be where the user was located, effectively prohibiting the user from being able to view other areas of the map."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"During this hacking period, we built long lasting relationships and an even more amazing project.

These were all entirely new to many of our team and we have learned a lot about full stack development throughout this weekend. We are also proud of our beautiful user interface. We were able to design extremely funny, punny, and visually appealing UIs, despite this being most of our's first time working with such things. Most importantly of all, we are proud of our perseverance; we never gave up throughout the entire hacking period, despite all of the challenges we faced, especially the stomach aches from staying up for two nights straight.
