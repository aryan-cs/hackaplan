This allows for, by ML standards, very fast clustering and incremental learning.\n\nAfter the model is initially trained, it's possible to incrementally fit new data, with the option of retraining the vectorizer. It's also possible to simply evaluate new information.\n\nBackend We built the backend with a Flask server and some Socket.io sockets. We did also use some OpenAI API integration, but the bulk of the backend was just GET requests that were rerouted to the Docker domain socket through Python bindings of the Docker SDK.\n\nFrontend For the frontend, we mainly used React and Tailwind for styling.
