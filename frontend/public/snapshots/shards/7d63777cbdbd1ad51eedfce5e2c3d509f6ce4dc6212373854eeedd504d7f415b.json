For now, we can play a select number of songs, as well as midi files transposed into one octave."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We essentially took advantage of every trashcan we could find. From dirty beer bottles to citrus flavored laxative, we explored all aspects of commonly recyclable waste to breathe new life into these objects."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had an extremely difficult time deciding on how to produce the sounds. We tried strings of various tensions and swinging paddles hitting mason jars until we eventually settled on nuts dropped onto glass bottles."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We quickly realized that this project was going to be a lot to handle for a 20hr makeathon, but despite our initial doubts, everyone was able to pull together and contribute to something bigger than themselves in the end."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned the importance of specialization. Everyone in the group was tasked with a separate aspect of the project, be it coding, machining, or wiring. But we believe that our split efforts made this a worthwhile and fulfilling experience."},{"heading":"What's next for TrashTalker","content":"At this point, TrashTalker is limited to 8 tones. We hope to expand its musical range significantly in the future with more bottles and more motors for more beautiful sounds."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"java javascript matlab node.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Holla","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/holla-gj8n1c","tagline":"An interactive screaming battle!

Both players scream as loud as they can into the sound chambers until one fills all the LEDs with their color. Screaming louder pushes a player's beam further towards the other side. When the two beams meet, they push against each other and the movement is determined by the difference in the screaming volumes."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"The Box","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/the-box","tagline":"A bunch of buttons on a box that play minigames","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT Presents: Horizons 2020","hackathon_url":"https://horizons2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"People's Choice"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"tears","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"tears"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:53:17.605807Z"}}
