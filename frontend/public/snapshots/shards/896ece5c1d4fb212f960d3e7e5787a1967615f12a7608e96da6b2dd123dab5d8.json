It’s so easy to get comfortable in our own echo chambers, lost in opinions that seem so real because they’re all around us. But sometimes we can’t look at life as a bigger picture unless we take a step back and empathize with people we don’t normally talk about.\n\n7cups, a site where I volunteered to talk to anonymous strangers about their lives, helped me do that. BubblePop was inspired to do the same."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"BubblePop presents you with a series of opinions. Chocolate is life; Psychopaths are simply less socially inhibited; The US should implement a junk food tax. Swipe up, down, left, or right - your choice. Once done, you’re connected with your furthest neighbor - a stranger who answered the most differently from you. Meet up and say hello!\n\nOn a more serious note, recently with the advent of social media oligarchies, fake news, and extremist groups, division of opinion has received a reputation as the enemy of societal progress. This shouldn't be the case, though.\n\nWe create a place where people can anonymously proclaim their opinions on various articles regarding pressing issues. Then, we match people with differing opinions and encourage them to meet and discuss in a productive fashion. We hope to foster a diverse yet highly empathetic community."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"Firebase Realtime Database - Opinion bank storage, profile storage, and partner matching state storage- Twilio - Effortless peer to peer calling Code and iOS - main platform"},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"First: Our team was quite unprepared for iOs since only one teammate had briefly worked with the platform and we only had two and a half Macs out of the four of us. Nevertheless, we learned iOs literally overnight and pulled through on the project.\n\nSecond: I wish I paid more attention in university math classes. For one of the first times in my life, I was required to think mathematically about a computer science problem. The goal was to transform the longitude and latitude coordinates of myself and my match, as well as my current compass direction, into a two-dimensional vector of how I should move to quickly reach my match. Unfortunately, after my teammate and I stressed for over six hours on this issue, reading mathematical formulas again and again while questioning whether we actually understood any of it, we finally settled on a semi-satisfactory compromise. In other words, we hacked it."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"Half the things stated above."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"How iOS works, how iOS doesn’t work, and how iOS sometimes works."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arkit coreml firebase swift twilio"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"FLUent","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/treehacks-pejm73","tagline":"An app designed to assist doctors in making decisions on handing out antibiotic prescriptions","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/779/099/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most Creative"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"django","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/django"},{"name":"geo2r","url":null},{"name":"gsea","url":null},{"name":"highcharts","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/highcharts"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"sklearn","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/Daniel-Davies/TreeHacks"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"css django geo2r gsea highcharts html javascript python sklearn"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Block n Doc","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/aperta","tagline":"Your medical records for a greater good.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most Impactful Contribution to Open Source Project"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"blockstack","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blockstack"},{"name":"cryptography","url":null},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/altrum/Treehacks"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Kate visited 35 doctors before she got her diagnosis--and it was stage 4 cancer. Part of the reason was her lack of control when it came to her medical records. As she traveled to specialists in hope to shed light into her painful symptoms, the transfer of records lagged behind. In fact, it was her own self-reliance that after 35 visits, she requested a CAT scan and found the root of her sickness.\n\nThe sheer number of visits that Kate went through is indicative of how much we trust our doctors--and a lack of autonomy on our own health. What if a scientist across the world could have easily seen her records and had given Kate advice? What if, a machine learning scientist had a model that could accurately detect the cancer that Kate had? What if, those doctors who saw her could have had more information and context behind her illness?\n\nTo address these issues, we wanted to leverage the blockstack platform to accomplish the following tasks:\n\n1) Users have total control over access and location of their records. 2) An open-source layer can link participants and researchers to carry out public policy studies and ML training. 3) The user can securely and safely disclose their medical data with others whom he or she desires.\n\nWe're excited to show you our vision of healthcare where doctors, data-scientists, family members, and individuals can all work together to advance one of the most backward systems in the world today."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We leverage blockstack and cryptography to achieve the following results:\n\n1) A user can selectively share their data with people of his or her choosing. This is powered by sophisticated public-private key exchanges.\n\n2) The user has complete control over her data; only she can fully see, manipulate, and distribute her own data. However, we ensure that the user can't act maliciously by requiring medical records to be signed digitally by medical professionals where it can ensure integrity of the document.\n\n3) Our application acts as a middle layer where we can link willing participants to medical professionals, data scientists, and other researchers who are interested in helping progress healthcare. This is all based on a opt-in system and is mindful of censoring certain information."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the more fundamental libraries/API's we hoped to leverage had potential bugs and roadblocks which, unfortunately, meant we had to come up with a new system design for our application the night before. We were bummed because our original solution would have been more elegant, polished, and would have allowed us to do much more."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Fully understanding a completely new framework within the span of the hackathon.

We have three modes:\n\nNavigate/Discover: the user is stationary and scans their phone around their surroundings. The phone continuously vibrates at an intensity proportional to the distance of the objects being pointed at. This way the user can \"feel\" the depth of an environment. Simultaneously, a vision network is identifying objects in the frame, and the phone narrates to the user \"person five feet away,\" or \"water bottle two feet away\" to provide important contextual information.\n\nTouch: the user tells the phone what types of objects they are interested in identifying. Then, the user scans the phone around the environment, and the phone alerts the user when an object of interest is detected. Similar to the \"Discover\" mode, the phone vibrates more as the user approaches the object, then finally alerts the user when they are about to bump into the object."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built a Swift iOS app, completely powered by Houndify's conversational interface and CoreML.

Gingivitis can lead to gum disease (also called “periodontitis”), which is found in 9% of the American population (1); The situation is even more dire elsewhere in the world (2). Gingivitis has recently been implicated as a cause for Alzheimer’s, as the gingivitis bacteria enters the brain (3).\n\nIn 2016, US dental costs totaled approximately $124 billion (4).

However, in a recent survey, when asked why they did not bike to work, over 65% of respondents cited 'safety concerns' as the most important factor. This is not unfounded -- in 2016, nearly four thousand cyclists were killed in road accidents.\n\nWhen our team looked at addressing this issue, we learned that visibility or unsafe road conditions played a role in over 85% of the crashes recorded."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"MOJO is an integrated solution for making bicyclists safer. A raspberry pi-based bike attachment functions as an ultra-bright weatherproof taillight, adding convenience and improving safety through the use of multiple strobe modes and intelligent turn and brake signals. Using MOJO's turn and brake signals allows bicyclists to keep both hands on the handlebars, increasing controllability and braking authority compared to traditional signaling methods. MOJO's built-in GPS makes bikes nearly impossible to misplace, as parking locations can be recorded and pushed to the cloud. Additionally, MOJO's website combines GPS data with public safety records, enabling users to view their bike routes in the context of recorded road conditions and traffic accidents and thus plan safer commutes."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Bike Attachment\n\nMOJO's bike attachment consists of a raspberry pi running raspbian stretch-lite and Circuit Python. Circuit Python scripts are used to interface with the GPIO header for controlling an external GPS, a strip of ultra-bright SK6812 RGBW LEDs, a magnetometer/gyro/accelerometer, and a remote used for controlling turn signals. Accelerometer data is used to create a \"brake light\" effect on the LED strip when the bike slows down, and gyro data is used to implement intelligent turn signals that automatically turn off after a turn is completed.\n\nThe remote control for the bike attachment mounts to the handlebars, and consists of two buttons for triggering the left and right turn signals and a status LED. The status LED indicates what mode the taillight is in (turning left, turning right, hazard lights, brake light, etc), allowing the user to confirm that their signal is functioning without taking their eyes off the road. The GPS is used to log position information to the Raspberry Pi's SD card, and a Python script pushes GPS logs to the cloud using the Azure IoT suite as soon as an internet connection is detected. Position updates can be quite frequent in urban areas or universities with public wifi networks, or can be scheduled to run only when the bike comes within range of a home or work wifi network at the end of a commute. Optionally, an external cellular module can be added to the Pi for round-trip connectivity from just about anywhere. MOJO's position data allows users to keep track of where they parked their bike, and can be used with MOJO's web suite to analyze road risks and plan safer routes.\n\nAll of the external components of MOJO's bike attachment are waterproofed with silicone, and the housings are constructed from durable PETG plastic and sealed with TPU gaskets. MOJO is IP64 water resistant and capable of handling the outdoor weather.\n\nWeb Suite\n\nMOJO's web suite allows riders to visualize the riding risks in their local area in order to better plan their routes. Public safety data ranging from local crime rates to pavement quality to traffic accidents is compiled and rendered as a heatmap, allowing MOJO users to see the riskiest parts of their commutes and plan accordingly, whether it's slowing down to keep an extra close eye on a certain blind intersection or taking a different street altogether."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Some of our web integrations had difficulty working with third-party apps, and building hardware was extremely resource and time intensive."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of the level of polish that we were able to build into our hardware prototype. No breadboards, no duct tape, and basic waterproofing proved to be a challenge, but we think it looks pretty good!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Despite not running Real Time Operating Systems, Raspberry Pi's are fantastic for embedded systems development! Their incredibly high clock rate when compared to many embedded devices removes many of the issues with timing resolution, at least for basic tasks like I2C / SPI / UART communication, and there are ample tools for interfacing with a large variety of sensors."},{"heading":"What's next for MOJO","content":"We'd like to continue improving our hardware and web platform; adding cellular connectivity to the bike attachment would allow it to upload data from more places, and solar panels could extend the life of the bike's battery while running MOJO. The web platform could be expanded to auto-generate safer bike routes from the data it already has, making safe biking easier than ever.\n\nMore Images"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"azure azure-iot-suite bash esri python raspberry-pi wix"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com cahogan16.wixsite.com"}]},{"project_title":"Soteria ","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/soteria-403mgo","tagline":"Soteria provides travelers with relevant, real-time health and safety information in an interactive map.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/764/414/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Esri] Best Hack with Esri APIs and SDKs"},{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Facebook] Best Hack to Make the World More Informed"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"esri","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/esri"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"gis","url":null},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"rest-api","url":null},{"name":"scrapy","url":null},{"name":"sketch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sketch"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/arihant72600/Soteria-Map"},{"label":"soteriamaps.com","url":"https://soteriamaps.com/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Staying healthy while traveling is a priority for many people, but getting a complete picture of all the health risks and required preparations is time consuming and tedious.

Thankfully, the surrounding Stanford community does not tend to cause any issues, but things may have played out differently in another city.\n\nUniversity Park, the home of USC, has one of the highest property crime rates in all of Los Angeles, ranking 8th out of 209 neighborhoods. It is nearly impossible to walk more than a block around campus without spotting the lonely remnants of a stolen bike. This pattern repeats not only around USC, but at the home schools of countless other hackers.\n\nNew college students, as well as other groups unfamiliar with the area (i.e. tourists, visitors, expats), represent some of the most vulnerable groups to theft and robberies. Becoming the victim does not only stop at losing your belongings--sexual assault is notoriously known to be a serious problem within college campuses. Our hack aims to help people in these situations, as well as provide valuable information to share with those who serve to protect us.\n\nWhat Flare does\n\nFlare is a mobile app that helps students stay safe within their communities by mapping out crimes around their college campus. Crime pockets can arise within specific areas due to geographical factors (such as location, lighting, police patrol schedules), and Flare helps students identify these areas. Flare shows students that sometimes it’s not always worth it to take a shortcut through that alleyway, or to leave your car a block away for free parking. After all, it only takes one bad incident to change the course of your entire life.\n\nCurrently, Flare provides crime mapping services to four college campuses in the Los Angeles area: USC, UCLA, CSUN, and CSULA.\n\nAlthough other crime mapping solutions exist, they fall into one of two categories: 1) report-by-report crime maps , with informative, yet extremely cluttered interfaces), or 2) neighborhood-generalizing maps used to inform real estate investors or encourage sales of home security systems . Flare combines the best of both worlds, intuitive design cues to present data meaningfully without sacrificing transparency.\n\nHow we built it\n\nFlare was built as an iOS app using Xcode and Swift. We used Esri’s ArcGIS Runtime SDK for iOS to display the maps of college campus neighborhoods. In order to get our crime statistics (time, location, description, etc.) we used the LA Times’ crime maps . We had to do some hacking and front-end processing magic in order to use their data, because not only is their API not public, their JSON isn’t returned as a string but rather a JS object encoded as a string. This meant that no JSON parser could parse their json file, because it wasn’t actually a legitimate JSON object. To get around that we did some magic with Swift’s JSContext class by hard coding a js function, calling it using Swift’s JS engine and then getting the object returned as an array of Any objects. We then had to map this to a JSON array and then from there decode them into our Crime models.\n\nAfter we were able to get the data from LA times, the rest was fairly straightforward. We found the neighbourhoods containing and surrounding the schools we chose for this demo -- USC, UCLA, CSULA, CSUN -- and then loaded those crime statistics on launch. We also used Apple’s location services to detect the real-time threat level based of the user using crime statistics of that month in order to convey to the user what type of danger they are in or if they should be worried at all.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nDue to all of the different policing agencies at play and lack of publicly available datasets, we initially had trouble finding data to work with. Our first idea was to use incidence reports sent via. email from campus police to students, however, the low volume of data points and inconsistencies within the data made it a poor choice.\n\nFortunately, we were able to stumble upon the the Los Angeles Times’ Mapping L.A. API , which sources directly from the LAPD and the LA County Sheriff’s Department . Although this limited the scope of our project to just Los Angeles County, the high quality of the data and ease of use (after jumping over some hurdles) made it a no-brainer to use in our hack.\n\nWe also ran into minor technical challenges, such as having to use a JS-specific method in Swift. However, thanks to the great online community at Stack Overflow we were able to find solutions pretty quickly.\n\nAccomplishments that we’re proud of\n\nWe’re very proud of the quality of our app given how quickly we had to build it out. We were able to build an almost full-featured app with a fleshed out design that not only has a great UI/UX but also is very useful for students across the US, all in less than a day.\n\nWhat’s next for Flare\n\nCollaboration with campus security agencies Expansion into non-college markets, other cities in California, and beyond Normalize data from all different databases, so we can offer this product/service to every campus\n\nBuilt with\n\nSwift, ArcGIS iOS SDK, Reactive Cocoa, Alamofire, JavaScript, MapKit, CocoaPods, Carthage, Xcode"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"alamofire arcgis-ios-sdk carthage cocoapods javascript mapkit reactive-cocoa swift xcode"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"PEAK (Virtual Interview Prep)","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/peak-virtual-interview-prep","tagline":"VR interview prep offers mock interviews and performance feedback to boost self-confidence in job seekers.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/765/126/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Disney] Best Entertainment Hack (Film, Television, or Theme Parks)"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"natural-language-processing","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/natural-language-processing"},{"name":"oculus-rift-vr","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"},{"name":"wix.com","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"www.peak-point.org","url":"https://www.peak-point.org"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/vmishra04/Peak"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Interviews can be intimidating.

We did not follow onward with this path.\n\nWe instead looked to our own experience. Our team had previously analyzed the connection between image recognition and natural language processing and their shared relationship to high dimensional spaces see here . We took these learnings and built a model that minimized the root mean squared error as it upscaled from 240 to 480 px.\n\nHowever, we quickly hit a wall, as this pixel based loss consistently left the upscaled output with blurry edges. In order to address these edges, we used our model as the Generator in a Generative Adversarial Network. However, our generator was too powerful, and the discriminator was lost.\n\nWe decided then to leverage the work of the researchers before us in order to build this application for the people. We loaded a pretrained VGG network and leveraged its image embeddings as preprocessing for our discriminator. Leveraging this pretrained model, we were able to effectively iron out the blurry edges while still minimizing mean squared error.\n\nNow model built.

And understanding how to proceed with one's life after being assaulted is challenging due to how scattered information on resources for these victims is for different communities, whether the victim is on an American college campus, in a foreign country, or any number of other situations. Instead of building a single solution or organizing one set of resources to help sexual assault victims everywhere, we believe a simple, community-driven solution to this problem lies in Echo."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Using Blockstack, Echo facilitates anonymized communication among sexual assault victims, legal and medical help, and local authorities to foster a supportive online community for victims. Members of this community can share their stories, advice, and support for each other knowing that they truly own their data and it is anonymous to other users, using Blockstack. Victims may also anonymously report incidents of assault on the platform as they happen, and these reports are shared with local authorities if a particular individual has been reported as an offender on the platform several times by multiple users. This incident data is also used to geographically map where in small communities sexual assault happens, to provide users of the app information on safe walking routes."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"A crucial part to feeling safe as a sexual harassment survivor stems from the ability to stay anonymous in interactions with others. Our backend is built with this key foundation in mind. We used Blockstack’s Radiks server to create a decentralized application that would keep all user’s data local to that user. By encrypting their information when storing the data, we ensure user privacy and mitigate all risks to sacrificing user data. The user owns their own data. We integrated Radiks into our Node and Express backend server and used this technology to manage our database for our app. On the frontend, we wanted to create an experience that was eager to welcome users to a safe community and to share an abundance of information to empower victims to take action. To do this, we built the frontend from React and Redux, and styling with SASS. We use blockstack’s Radiks API to gather anonymous messages in the Support Room feature. We used Twilio’s message forwarding API to ensure that victims could very easily start anonymous conversations with professionals such as healthcare providers, mental health therapists, lawyers, and other administrators who could empower them. We created an admin dashboard for police officials to supervise communities, equipped with Esri’s maps that plot where the sexual assaults happen so they can patrol areas more often. On the other pages, we aggregate online resources and research into an easy guide to provide victims the ability to take action easily. We used Azure in our backend cloud hosting with Blockstack."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into issues of time, as we had ambitious goals for our multi-functional platform. Generally, we faced the learning curve of using Blockstack’s APIs and integrating that into our application.

This often results in long term separation or even indefinite separation of the parents and children, since the parents, many of whom are still fighting to stay in the US, have little to no information or time to track down their children at one of many federal detention centers. Juntos' mission is to create an avenue by which these separate families can be reunited. Because it is typically hard for young children to reach out to their families other than being able to recognize them, we have employed methods such as deep learning and computer vision to help create a network of intelligence that will hopefully bring these families together."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Juntos, in a broad sense, serves as an image to individual matching system. Users, including both parents and children at detention facilities, will submit a photo of themselves and a photo of the person they are looking for, if they have one. In the case that the individual lacks such a photo, we use a generative adversarial network (GAN) to help reconstruct an image of an individual from only basic descriptions of facial features such as face shape. Juntos then uses a mobile platform to create a common platform for users to identify one another, with features such as location maps of images in the database, as well as generating suggestions of others' profile pictures that closely resemble the target description."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The GAN model behind Juntos comprises of two pretrained models, one of which is the CelebA dataset that has facial biometrics labeled for each image, and the other is the Flickr-Faces-HQ dataset, an extremely diverse set of pictures of faces. Next, we used these models to create a mapping from measurable facial features to the latent space , or the input space to the GAN, thus allowing us to recreate faces based off a set of descriptors. In order to make Juntos a more user friendly experience, we experimented multiple types of UI to select the features (buttons and sliders). First of all, we tried out buttons which had one major drawback: selection would not always be precise because some features were interconnected (e.g. increasing the probability of a goatee on the face naturally made the entire face appear more masculine, even when 'female' was selected). In the end, we decided to go with a slider system, which allowed for free form configuration of features without confusing the user."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One challenge that we ran into was that when we were calculating the mapping from the feature space to the latent space, the amount of data we had to use to have a good map was extremely large, and exceeded the capabilities of the server. As a result, we had to use clever pipelining to be able to do this processing, such as computing the mapping in a series of iterated steps. Another challenge we faced was integrating the project components. Specifically, because our project had a large range of technologies, we ended up each working on our own portion of the project at first, so integrating the project effectively at the end was crucial to our success."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"One accomplishment we're proud of was that we managed to understand the details behind the GAN algorithm through reading many papers and experiments online, even though we did not come in with any prior experience with them. We also put together a full functional pipeline in a condensed amount of time. One of our group members even managed to connect on LinkedIn with one of the first authors of the GAN!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Through building our project, we learned good design and version control practices that helped prevent major setbacks when things went wrong. We also learned about servers and various other technologies that together comprise a full stack project."},{"heading":"What's next for Juntos","content":"With regards to the technical aspect of our project, we would like to improve the feature extractor we used. As noted above, it is currently trained on celebrity images, and so is biased toward features that celebrities tend to have. Training the feature extractor on a dataset more representative of our target population, with labels more closely corresponding to features we want to tune, would make the generator be easier to work with for arriving at a target image.\n\nThis project can be generalized to not just reuniting migrant families, but also searching for people in general. Some possibilities are searching for lost children and missing persons, or allowing law enforcement to create more accurate pictures from eyewitness accounts. Swapping the backend out for GANs trained on other datasets would allow for searching for other things as well - in particular, a GAN trained to generate pictures of dogs, or pictures of cats, would allow people to use this app to search for runaway pets."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"amazon-web-services express.js gan keras node.js rabbitmq react tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com junto.verafy.me"}]},{"project_title":"CheckHealth","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/littlebirdy","tagline":"Taking notes during patient visits, CheckHealth eliminates the need for physicians to manually input electronic data.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/765/693/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[SoundHound] Best Use of SoundHound API (3rd place)"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"csv","url":null},{"name":"houndify","url":null},{"name":"json","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/saahilchadha1/TreeHacks2019"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We noticed two big problems in the medical field.

The deep learning emotion classification on the backend was conducted through the Google Cloud Vision API, and 3D models were generated through Blender and also downloaded from Sketchfab and Turbosquid."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Since it was our first time working with ARKit and mobile development, learning the ins and outs of Swift as well as created augmented reality objects was truly and eye-opening experience. Also, since the backend API calls to the Vision API call were asynchronous, we had to carefully plan and track the flow of inputs (i.e. taps) and outputs for our app. Also, finding suitable 3D models for our app also required much work – most online models that we found were quite costly, and as a result we ultimately generated our own 3D face expression emoji models with Blender."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Building a fully functional app, working with Swift and ARKit for the first time, successfully integrating the Vision API into our mobile backend, and using Blender for the first time!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"ARKit, Swift, physics for augmented reality, and using 3D modeling software. We also learned how to tailor the user experience of our software specifically to our audience to make it as usable and intuitive as possible. For instance, we focused on minimizing the amount of text and making sure all taps would function as expected inside our app."},{"heading":"What's next for KidsEmote","content":"KidsEmote represents a complete digital paradigm shift in the way autistic children are treated. While much progress has been made in the past 36 hours, KidsEmote opens up so many more ways to equip children with autism with the necessary interpersonal skills to thrive in social situations. For instance, KidsEmote can be easily extended to help autistic children recognize between different emotions from the tone of one's voice, and understand another's mood based on their body gesture. Integration between all these various modalities only yields more avenues for exploration further down the line. In the future, we also plan on incorporating video streaming abilities into KidsEmote to enable autistic children from all over the world to play with each other and meet new friends. This would greatly facilitate social interaction on an unprecedented scale between children with autism since they might not have the opportunity to do so in otherwise in traditional social contexts. Lastly, therapists can also instruct parents to KidsEmote as an at-home tool to track the progress of their children – helping parents become part of the process and truly understand how their kids are improving first-hand."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"3d ar-kit augmented-reality blender deep-learning google-cloud-vision ios swift"}]},{"project_title":"GoCalmly","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/go-calmly","tagline":"Diffuse tension between drivers and law enforcement and infuse awareness of cooperative behaviors and driver’s rights","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/765/022/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2019","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"[Twilio] Best Use of Twilio"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"figma","url":null},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"ibm-watson","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ibm-watson"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"twilio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/jpbesgen/treehacks2019"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"When the word “police” is typed into the Google search bar, the third suggestion to come up is police brutality. While tragic, this is unsurprising to most of us. After seeing a few hashtags on Twitter, we became numb to the pain caused by the disconnect between civilians and the police. It’s worth noting that police brutality is a phrase burned into our brains, but driver uncooperativeness during traffic stops is not. The risks associated with traffic stops affect both law enforcement officers and drivers, and misunderstandings have the ability to result in irreversible consequences amidst the tension. As a law enforcement officer, the risk of walking up to a foreign car on the side of a busy road is gargantuan. As a driver, being pulled over is nerve-wracking. It’s foreign and uncomfortable – especially if a driver is unprepared. However, it is also the duty of every driver to be prepared; to be aware of the rules, to be aware of their rights, and to be aware of how to appropriately handle a traffic stop. Enter GoCalmly.\n\nWe created an application that would encourage drivers to meet law enforcement officers in the middle – to support more fair and respectful exchanges during traffic stops. After some research, we identified that the two user groups most impacted by this app would be teen drivers and young male African American drivers. The statistics on teenage accidents are astonishing, and it is no surprise that newer drivers are less likely to be familiar with road rules and have less knowledge on how to interact with law enforcement in a productive way. The correlation between African American drivers being stopped and searched is exponentially higher than that of any other race in America, and we knew that our app had a massive potential to alleviate tension within America’s black community."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"GoCalmly is a hands-free tool that educates the driver on how to de-escalate the situation in the event of a traffic stop. The program runs through a short dialogue with the user when a traffic stop environment is detected. This event is recognized using the IBM Watson API to establish the presence of police vehicles using computer vision. Further triggers of the traffic stop environment are the distinct frequency of police officer sirens and accelerometer measurements that detect the car slowing down.\n\nFor the use case of a teen driver, we thought of our own personal experiences as teenage drivers and remembered how our driving emotion was fear in a traffic stop situation. We decided to combat fear with empathy and love. Our application features the ability to pre-record a message from a loved one, such as a parent, to ease the driver through the process of safely executing a traffic stop. If the user chooses not to pre-record a message, then the Watson API uses text-to-speech recognition to give the driver tips encouraging cooperation, deep breaths, and some basic driver’s rights for the law enforcement encounter.\n\nOnce the vehicle is stopped, the app has stored copies of user documents such as their driver’s license and registration in the event that they are unable to find those identification documents during the traffic stop. While this probably won’t help the driver avoid a citation, it helps the encounter.\n\nThe application begins recording audio that can be reviewed following the traffic stop as evidence for unlawful treatment or simply to remember the citations issued during the stop. Furthermore, in the case of the driver becoming unable to contact a loved one, the app also features an automated text creator to the predetermined emergency contact so that others are informed of the driver's location and situation.\n\nFollowing the traffic stop, the application uses speech-recognition to pick out keywords from the conversation that point the user to next steps such as paying a citation online, going to traffic school, or filing further legal complaints."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had no knowledge of the African American driver persona and with the time constraint, had little to no way of attempting to do nearly enough human-to-human research to fully empathize with the community and the main pain points. Since so much of the tension and trauma within this specific use case is deeply emotionally driven- we knew actually talking to people was the only way to determine every single pain point and that articles and statistics could only get us so far."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re very happy that we’re bringing awareness to police brutality in a less biased light. The simple fix of drivers being informed and cooperating would make that many traffic stops smoother and less scary and the days of that many law enforcement officers a little safer.\n\nWe’re proud of the integration of many different features and APIs, and we are excited by the brand we were able to create through the UI/UX."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Ways to improve our own safety in the event of traffic stops. By researching the traffic stop from the point-of-view of police officers as well as new drivers, we could better understand the needs of our user group. Through our research, we also unearthed the most comprehensive list of reminders and rights for drivers to know when in a traffic stop and determined five different “next steps” paths for a teen driver after they have been through a traffic stop.\n\nThis was so enlightening for our team because we learned several driver’s rights we were previously unaware of and helpful behaviors that we will now aim to implement if in this position in the future. We hope our application can have the same eye-opening effect on others."},{"heading":"What's next for GoCalmly","content":"How might we create an insightful user persona for young African American males?

If the doctor doesn't speak the patient's language, it's a huge source of inefficiency and could cost the patient their life."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Dogtag is a web application that stores critical medical information like medications, allergies, D.O.B., etc. that are able to be legally stored locally on the user's phone under Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and adds to hospital infrastructure allowing for easy sharing of records protected under HIPAA. When a patient is in dire need of medical help, they will have all of their critical and non-HIPAA information stored on the device, which can be accessed under a specific user QR code. When the patient enters the hospital, the hospital will be able to use the QR code stored on the device to pull up their critical medical information. Doing so will also send a request to insurance providers and primary care providers and send necessary medical records (ie. past doctor visits, patient's blood types, family medical history, etc.) so that the hospital / doctor has the necessary information and can start working with the patient immediately. If the patient is in a country where they don't speak the language, the platform will automatically translate the necessary information into the native language of that country."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"This application was built using Electron for the front-end and Node.js deployed with Docker for the back-end. Each backend contained a Docker container with the server code and another with the database, which was MongoDB at the central server and PostgreSQL at hospital servers. All communication is encrypted with 2048-bit RSA with random cipher keys."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Originally, we wanted to challenge ourselves and use React Native to build the app, but we decided to stick to what we were more familiar with, which was Electron.

We trained this prediction model against data from prior wildfires in the United States. We then used IBM cloud to integrate this prediction model into our Wix website."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We found that incorporating all of our results onto a Wix website was a lot more difficult than we had anticipated.
