Get results in 1-2 seconds."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"The frontend of the app was built using a chrome extension framework and APIs, as well as fundamental languages like HTML, CSS, JS, and Bootstrap. The server was hosted on an Azure T4 GPU, pros to being backed by Microsoft for Startups, and was used to run high inference implementation code. Prior to code base migration, the code was unit tested on a NVIDIA RTX laptop, provided by MLH. The algorithm utilizes parallelism in the pipeline to process multiple tasks at the same time. YouTube's search and transcript APIs are used to fetch the necessary data contents necessary. All-MiniLM-L6-v2 embeddings from HuggingsFace are used to extract chunks across the data. A novel algorithm is in place using turing machines, recursive divide and conquer sub-algorithms, and other inputs to extract answers based on queries."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"One challenge I ran into was getting access to an Azure T4 GPU. The GPU market is terrible and this one was hard to pull off after a lengthy email conversation and ticket. Another challenge was reducing the latency. When I started building this algorithm, it took nearly 30 seconds. Now it gets the job done in 1-2 seconds. This is all thanks to all the optimizations in place, from converting the model to ONNX files to using optimal data structures. Another challenge was limited time for testing. So I got my friends to test the product I made and give user feedback on areas where it failed. Based on feedback I received, for example limited context, I was able to expand on ideas; for example, the chrome extension takes more content than what you highlight under some scenarios (based on another semantic comparison algorithm) in order to produce more accurate results. One last challenge I faced, in addition to other multiple minor ones, was integrating the extension with OpenAI. Web scraping was a lengthy task and involved a lot of testing, rather than just writing code in one-go and compiling it in one-go, which took a lot of time, but the end product was really useful based on the feedback I received."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"Having a 1-2 second latency to provide very accurate results is simply fascinating to me.

One teammate recently had a house fire, and thanks to the quick response from the fire department, many parts of the house were salvaged. In lieu of this recent event, we wondered how to help support the fire department through the use of technology to save others from the same experience. By allowing them to review their performance in a more immersive manner to prevent people like our teammate from going through such events.\n\nAfter speaking with our friend who works as a firefighter near our college’s campus, as well as extensive background research, we found out that the current system for performance reviews relies on personal experience and video footage. In order to enhance these reviews, we decided to use 3D modeling and virtual reality to transform the process. The lossy act of remembering one’s decisions in a life-or-death moment can then be replaced by interactive 3D reconstructions of mission history. So, an immersive replay of the fire response can thus prove to improve performance and save more lives in the future."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our solution uses VR technology to create an immersive replay of the fire response. The reviewer puts on the headset and sees an information rich graph, alerting them to key moments in the fire response (special points of interest). Then they select these points in time and are teleported to the actions of the firefighters during this time. The firefighter's exact actions are captures using 3D reconstruction technology.\n\nUsing monocular video data (single camera, like a firefighter helmet cam) we generated a point cloud using SLAM technology and then a 3D mesh through point meshing algorithm to detail the environment the fighter went through. We then implemented a graph on the user’s sidebar to examine the room’s temperature change, modeled from a realistic dataset created by simulation, over the fire’s duration. This is used to identify points of interest through the fire. Additionally, we simulated room temperature data spatially using a meshed plot. Our 3D model depicts how the temperature of a room could be displayed for a user to examine specific areas of the room that had high temperature peaks, and this used to identify areas of interest within the room for training exercises and performance reviews."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Used Unity3D VR, MATLAB, Colmap"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"In MATLAB, we had to overcome one technical challenge of exporting a 3D graph with interactive features in order to make a meaningful connection with the VR technology.

Predicated on the intricate interplay of government regulations and insurance company policies, the accessibility of fair insurance premiums has remained elusive. FarmShield emerged as a response to these challenges, with a vision to streamline and enhance the accessibility of farm insurance through technological innovation.\n\nDevelopment Insight\n\nOur journey commenced with an in-depth analysis of the existing insurance framework, which revealed a significant reliance on USDA decisions, leading to minimal flexibility in premium adjustments by insurance providers. This insight laid the foundational premise for FarmShield: to introduce a custom safety score, enabling reductions in insurance rates by 5-30% through advanced satellite imagery analysis.\n\nData Acquisition and Analysis\n\nThe cornerstone of our approach involved meticulous data mining efforts, leveraging both public and proprietary datasets. Utilizing SAS software, we conducted rigorous regression analysis to unearth patterns and correlations between farm practices, environmental factors, and crop yield outcomes. This empirical analysis facilitated the creation of synthetic datasets, simulating potential insurance discounts grounded in quantifiable risk assessments.\n\nSatellite Imagery Utilization\n\nA pivotal aspect of FarmShield's innovation lies in the utilization of satellite imagery. By harnessing this technology, we generated detailed visual data maps of agricultural land, enabling the precision assessment of crop health, soil moisture levels, and other critical agronomic factors. This comprehensive analysis underpins our safety score algorithm, offering a nuanced risk evaluation mechanism that transcends traditional insurance assessment models.\n\nMachine Learning for Crop Protection\n\nParallel to our insurance innovation, we developed a machine learning model designed to diagnose plant health issues. This model was trained using an extensive dataset comprising images of healthy and diseased crops, encompassing a broad spectrum of agricultural diseases. Through advanced image recognition techniques, the model provides instantaneous diagnostic insights, empowering farmers with actionable information to safeguard their crops against potential threats.\n\nChallenges and Solutions\n\nThe endeavor to meld complex datasets, advanced analytics, and machine learning into a cohesive platform was fraught with challenges. Data normalization, ensuring model accuracy across diverse crop types, and the integration of disparate data sources required a multifaceted approach. Our solution was iterative refinement: continuous model training, validation, and adjustment, guided by both quantitative data and qualitative feedback from early adopters.\n\nProfessional Engagement\n\nFarmShield represents a collaborative effort between technology experts and the agricultural community. As a team of two, our roles spanned the gamut of data science, software development, and stakeholder engagement. This project is not merely a testament to technological innovation but a reflection of our commitment to enhancing the resilience and productivity of the farming sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nFarmShield stands at the confluence of agriculture and technology, embodying a forward-thinking approach to farm insurance and crop protection. Through diligent data analysis, innovative application of satellite imagery, and the development of a predictive machine learning model, we have laid the groundwork for a more equitable and informed agricultural insurance landscape. As we advance, we remain dedicated to refining our methodologies, expanding our dataset, and continuously improving the utility and accuracy of FarmShield for the agricultural community."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css excel excel-vba gee gee-data-catalog-api gee-javascript-api gee-python-api google-cloud google-earth-engine html javascript node.js rest sas"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"sites.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"MediCognize","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/medicognize","tagline":"Medicognize: AI-Powered Healthcare, Speedy Diagnostics, Global Specialist Access, and Multilingual Patient Support","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/002/829/933/datas/medium.jpeg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Spring 2024","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-spring-2024.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of AI & Verbwire API"},{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Spring 2024","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-spring-2024.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Starknet"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"auth0","url":null},{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"css3","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css3"},{"name":"html5","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"magicpilot.ai","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"relu","url":null},{"name":"starknet","url":null},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null},{"name":"verbwire","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/Karthikn9883/hack_princeton-.git"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Accessing quality specialist doctors is often hindered by long wait times, different appointment dates, and geographical barriers, making it difficult for people worldwide to receive the best healthcare possible.

Countless individuals have encountered situations where they receive medical bills that seem exorbitant or include charges for services they never received or were inaccurately billed. Such experiences often leave patients feeling helpless, as navigating the complex world of healthcare billing can be overwhelming and intimidating. We were moved by stories of individuals facing financial strain due to inflated medical bills, and we were determined to create a solution that empowers patients to advocate for themselves and challenge unfair billing practices. Our motivation comes from the belief that everyone deserves access to transparent and fair healthcare pricing, and our web app serves as a tool to level the playing field and ensure that patients are not exploited by unjust billing practices. Through our platform, we aspire to bring about positive change in the healthcare industry by promoting accountability, transparency, and consumer advocacy."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Recognizing the complexity of medical billing and the prevalence of errors and inflated charges, our platform utilizes advanced algorithms to compare itemized bills against industry standards and regional averages. Through a user-friendly interface, individuals can effortlessly upload their medical bills and receive instant feedback on discrepancies. Additionally, our platform guides users through the steps of filing complaints with relevant authorities or negotiating with healthcare providers for fairer pricing. We enhance user convenience and accessibility by integrating a Talkbot feature, which accepts user speech as input and generates AI-generated speech as output. This innovative approach streamlines the process even further, allowing users to interact with the platform naturally and receive guidance in real-time conversation. By demystifying medical billing and advocating for consumer rights through both advanced algorithms and user-friendly talkbot interactions, our web app endeavors to alleviate financial burdens and promote accountability within the healthcare system.\n\nIn addition to assisting users with their medical bills and complaints, our Talkbot serves as a versatile educational tool, offering insights into various aspects of healthcare and billing practices. Users can leverage the Talkbot to learn more about fraudulent billing schemes, understand data privacy and security measures, and delve into a wide array of healthcare-related topics. Whether it's understanding common billing errors, recognizing signs of fraudulent activity, or gaining knowledge about protecting personal health information, the Talkbot provides valuable information in an interactive and engaging manner. By offering educational resources and fostering awareness about consumer rights and healthcare best practices, our platform not only addresses immediate billing concerns but also empowers users with the knowledge needed to navigate the healthcare landscape confidently. Through the dual functionality of assistance and education, our web app strives to promote financial well-being, privacy awareness, and accountability within the healthcare system."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built it using a multitude of technologies to implement the entire functionality. We used google's cloud vision api to run OCR on the bills of the users to extract information about procedures and their costs. These prices are then compared to prices in the hospital price transparency database released under the Hospital Price Transparency act of the US government. We are filtering the results in the database based on the user's insurance provider to get the accurate average national cost for each service. We are then using react.js to build an easy to use web app that gives the user all of this information in an easy to understand format. We then also provide all this information as context to gemini pro so that we can implement a bot that can further guide the user as to how they can file a complaint for the overcharge. Additionally, we are using faster-whisper and TTS models for speech to text and text to speech functionality to implement an efficient, almost real time talk bot. We also use 0Auth to validate users and store their data, including previous bills and other personal data such as address in MongoDB which is also passed as context to the LLM."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Integrating all the different models into one smooth pipeline was a major challenge. Additionally connecting the frontend to the backend for the talk bot, and ensuring multiple data files were transferred successfully was a major challenge."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are really proud of the fact that we are quickly able to identify all the procedures the user underwent and are able to determine efficiently whether they have been overcharged against the national average for their particular insurance provider."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Throughout the development process, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of medical billing, the intricacies of integrating various technologies, and the importance of user-centric design. We learned how to effectively leverage cloud services like Google Cloud Vision API and Hospital Price Transparency databases to extract and compare billing data. Additionally, we honed our skills in frontend development with React.js and backend integration for seamless user experiences. The challenges we encountered provided opportunities for learning and growth, ultimately strengthening our understanding of healthcare systems and technological solutions."},{"heading":"What's next for Feasco","content":"Moving forward, we envision expanding Faircharge to offer even more comprehensive support and resources for healthcare consumers. We plan to enhance our Talkbot feature to provide personalized guidance tailored to each user's specific circumstances, including assistance with insurance claims, appeals, and negotiating medical bills. Furthermore, we aim to incorporate machine learning techniques to continuously improve accuracy in detecting overcharges and identifying potential billing errors. Additionally, we aspire to collaborate with healthcare organizations and advocacy groups to raise awareness about medical billing transparency and consumer rights. Ultimately, our goal is to empower individuals to take control of their healthcare finances and advocate for fair and equitable treatment within the healthcare system."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"auth0 faster-whisper gemini google-cloud mongodb ocr python react sql tts tts-api.com"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-17T06:14:36.202716Z"}}
