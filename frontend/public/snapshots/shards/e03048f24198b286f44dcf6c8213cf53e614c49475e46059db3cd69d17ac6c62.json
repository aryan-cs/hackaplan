While some of us live in the luxury of getting clean water for granted, some of us do not. In Flint, MI, another main water pipeline broke. Again. Under water boil advisory, citizens are subject to government inaction and lack of communication. Our goal is to empower communities with what is in their water using data analytics and crowd sourced reports of pollutants in tap water found in people's homes."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Water Crusader is an app that uses two categories of data to give communities an informed assessment of their water quality: publicly available government data and crowd sourced tap water assessments taken from people's homes. Firstly, it takes available government data of blood lead levels tested in children, records of home age to indicate the age of utilities and materials used in pipes, and income levels as an indicator of maintenance in a home. With the programs we have built, governments can expand our models by giving us more data to use. Secondly, users are supplied with a cost-effective, open source IOT sensor that uploads water quality measurements to the app. This empowers citizens to participate in knowing the water quality of their communities. As a network of sensors is deployed, real-time, crowd-sourced data can greatly improve our risk assessment models. By fusing critical information from these two components, we use regression models to give our users a risk measurement of lead poisoning from their water pipelines. Armed with this knowledge, citizens are empowered with being able to make more informed health decisions and call their governments to act on the problem of lead in drinking water."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Hardware: To simulate the sensor system with the available hardware materials at HackMIT, we used a ESP32 and DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor. The ESP32 takes temperature and humidity data read from DHT11. Data is received in Nose-RED json by specifying HTTP request and the sending actual post in the Arduino IDE.\n\nData Analytics: Using IBM's Watson Studio and AI development tools, data from government sources were cleaned and used to model lead poisoning risk. Blood lead levels tested in children from the Center for Disease Control was used as the feature we wanted to predict. House age and poverty levels taken from the U.S. Census were used to predict blood lead levels tested in children from the Center for Disease Control."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We are limited by the amount of hardware available.

Therefore, we created our app as an innovative piece of assistive tech to improve accessibility across the campus."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The user can find wheelchair accessible entrances with ease and get directions on where to find them."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started off using MIT’s Accessible Routes interactive map to see where the wheelchair friendly entrances were located at MIT. We then inspected the JavaScript code running behind the map to find the latitude and longitude coordinates for each of the wheelchair locations.\n\nWe then created a Python script that filtered out the latitude and longitude values, ignoring the other syntax from the coordinate data, and stored the values in separate text files.\n\nWe tested whether our method would work in Python first, because it is the language we are most familiar with, by using string concatenation to add the proper Java syntax to the latitude and longitude points. Then we printed all of the points to the terminal and imported them into Android Studio.\n\nAfter being certain that the method would work, we uploaded these files into the raw folder in Android Studio and wrote code in Java that would iterate through both of the latitude/longitude lists simultaneously and plot them onto the map.\n\nThe next step was learning how to change the color and image associated with each marker, which was very time intensive, but led us to having our custom logo for each of the markers.\n\nSeparately, we designed elements of the app in Adobe Illustrator and imported logos and button designs into Android Studio. Then, through trial and error (and YouTube videos), we figured out how to make buttons link to different pages, so we could have both a FAQ page and the map.\n\nThen we combined both of the apps together atop of the original maps directory and ironed out the errors so that the pages would display properly."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into/Accomplishments","content":"We had a lot more ideas than we were able to implement. Stripping our app to basic, reasonable features was something we had to tackle in the beginning, but it kept changing as we discovered the limitations of our project throughout the 24 hours. Therefore, we had to sacrifice features that we would otherwise have loved to add.\n\nA big difficulty for our team was combining our different elements into a cohesive project. Since our team split up the usage of Android Studio, Adobe illustrator, and programming using the Google Maps API, it was most difficult to integrate all our work together.\n\nWe are proud of how effectively we were able to split up our team’s roles based on everyone’s unique skills. In this way, we were able to be maximally productive and play to our strengths.\n\nWe were also able to add Boston University accessible entrances in addition to MIT's, which proved that we could adopt this project for other schools and locations, not just MIT."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We used Android Studio for the first time to make apps. We discovered how much Google API had to offer, allowing us to make our map and include features such as instant directions to a location. This helped us realize that we should use our resources to their full capabilities."},{"heading":"What's next for HandyMap","content":"If given more time, we would have added many features such as accessibility for visually impaired students to help them find entrances, alerts for issues with accessing ramps and power doors, a community rating system of entrances, using machine learning and the community feature to auto-import maps that aren't interactive, and much, much more.

New York, San Francisco, Chicago; these sprawling metropolises have so many things to do, places to go, and people to meet. However, urban life comes with its own dangers - even with a tactful degree of caution, or \"street smarts\", the possibility of stumbling into a bad situation is always present.\n\nA classmate of ours talked with us about his childhood growing up nearby in Boston. Though he loved living and exploring the city as a child, he told us that he was often unsure of whether it was safe to do so. Is anything dangerous happening nearby? What places should I avoid? He wished that there had been some way to know.\n\nHis wish isn't unique; over 250,000 people use an app called Citizen every month. According to the New York Times , Citizen employs teams of people to listen to emergency radios, the source of the most up-to-date information on potentially dangerous incidents, and send out location-based alerts. However, expansion has been slow; since debuting in New York City in 2017, they've expanded to just five cities.\n\nPeople in urban areas want this information, but there are many, many cities without it."},{"heading":"What Villager Does Differently","content":"Emergency radio is the best resource for live updates on crime and danger in the area, but no one has time to listen to a police scanner every day. This is where Villager comes in. We use Rev.ai's speech-to-text technology, natural language processing, and machine learning to analyze emergency radio audio and display it on our webapp. We provide this information straight from the source to the user with zero need for human resources. This, we believe, will enable both faster alert times and faster expansion to cities all over the US than Citizen can provide."},{"heading":"How It Works","content":"We access live audio streams provided by Broadcastify, which we then denoise and enhance using a spectral gating noise reduction pipeline. The processed audio is then fed into the Rev.ai API for speech-to-text transcription. The returned text is then processed using a natural language processing framework that identifies key named entities in the transcript such as the threats (i.e. reported crimes and weapons) and named locations (for instance, street intersections). The named locations are then converted to exact latitude-longitude values using the Google Maps Places Search API.\n\nThe threats and locations are then broadcast to a client that renders the threats in real-time using the Google Maps API.\n\nAt HackMIT, we processed 2/3 of a day's worth of audio for the Chicago Metropolitan Area, which is comprised of 11 separate police radio feeds. From this we estimate the daily cost of running our platform per app would be less than $100, the bulk of which is accounted for by the cost of the speech-to-text processing."},{"heading":"Challenges, Lessons, and the Future","content":"We realized early on that the audio quality of radio transmissions are not that great, so we had to do a lot of research on various audio processing techniques. We ended up building a custom pipeline that would remove a lot of the background noise in the audio, therefore priming it for processing by the Rev.ai API.\n\nThe other major challenge was making sure everything worked well together.

In order to encourage healthy eating, we are also donating a portion of the total value of healthy food to a food-related non-profit charity in the United States or abroad."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our application uses Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to capture items and their respective prices on scanned receipts. We then parse through these words and numbers using an advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithm to match grocery items with its nutritional values from a database. By analyzing the amount of calories, fats, saturates, sugars, and sodium in each of these grocery items, we determine if the food is relatively healthy or unhealthy. Then, we calculate the amount of money spent on healthy and unhealthy foods, and donate a portion of the total healthy values to a food-related charity. In the future, we plan to run analytics on receipts from other industries, including retail, clothing, wellness, and education to provide additional information on personal spending habits."},{"heading":"How We Built It","content":"We use AWS Textract and Instabase API for OCR to analyze the words and prices in receipts. After parsing out the purchases and prices in Python, we used Levenshtein distance optimization for text classification to associate grocery purchases with nutritional information from an online database. Our algorithm utilizes Pandas to sort nutritional facts of food and determine if grocery items are healthy or unhealthy by calculating a “healthiness” factor based on calories, fats, saturates, sugars, and sodium. Ultimately, we output the amount of money spent in a given month on healthy and unhealthy food."},{"heading":"Challenges We Ran Into","content":"Our product relies heavily on utilizing the capabilities of OCR APIs such as Instabase and AWS Textract to parse the receipts that we use as our dataset. While both of these APIs have been developed on finely-tuned algorithms, the accuracy of parsing from OCR was lower than desired due to abbreviations for items on receipts, brand names, and low resolution images. As a result, we were forced to dedicate a significant amount of time to augment abbreviations of words, and then match them to a large nutritional dataset."},{"heading":"Accomplishments That We're Proud Of","content":"Project Horus has the capability to utilize powerful APIs from both Instabase or AWS to solve the complex OCR problem of receipt parsing. By diversifying our software, we were able to glean useful information and higher accuracy from both services to further strengthen the project itself, which leaves us with a unique dual capability.\n\nWe are exceptionally satisfied with our solution’s food health classification. While our algorithm does not always identify the exact same food item on the receipt due to truncation and OCR inaccuracy, it still matches items to substitutes with similar nutritional information."},{"heading":"What We Learned","content":"Through this project, the team gained experience with developing on APIS from Amazon Web Services. We found Amazon Textract extremely powerful and integral to our work of reading receipts. We were also exposed to the power of natural language processing, and its applications in bringing ML solutions to everyday life. Finally, we learned about combining multiple algorithms in a sequential order to solve complex problems. This placed an emphasis on modularity, communication, and documentation."},{"heading":"The Future Of Project Horus","content":"We plan on using our application and algorithm to provide analytics on receipts from outside of the grocery industry, including the clothing, technology, wellness, education industries to improve spending decisions among the average consumers.

Although computationally expensive, our software is heavily optimized and implements a 2-layer cache system, with the 1st layer as warm Lambda storage and the 2nd layer as AWS DynamoDB. In this way, once a page's alt texts have been generated and cached once, any users of the page will effectively instantly have access to them. Very little data is passed between the client & API Gateway (only a URL and a dictionary of alt texts), meaning that alt texts will (generally) be available before the images actually load. Thus, it also benefits people with limited internet access.

Users are prompted to discuss the events of the day out loud, though they can enter text if they wish -- this style of information is more efficient and natural than the process required by most mood trackers, and encourages comprehensiveness and candor. Pilot then responds to the individual's sentiment and prompts them to reflect on their current mood further with a probing question. Once the user has responded to these questions, Pilot recommends how the user may be feeling on three different scales, mood, anxiety, and cynicism, allowing the user to adjust as they see fit. Once this step is complete, the destination is revealed and the user can explore the location they were matched to for that day. Pilot also provides users with a clean environment with which to view their mood and mental health history."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"We used Watson for sentiment analysis, Rev for speech-to-text, and Amadeus to identify sights and Mapbox and Wikipedia to display information about locations."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"We're extremely proud of all the features we were able to pack into Pilot in 24 hours."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"amadeus css django google-cloud html ibm-watson javascript mapbox python react.js rev.ai wikipedia"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"DHEA","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dhea","tagline":"Choose between a private insurance system, a national model, or something else entirely.

Without the ability to agree to contracts, we lose the ability to acquire services that may be vital for our well-being.\n\nBut we all know that contracts are often tedious and opaque, even for accustomed individuals. What about those groups which find this very hard?\n\nThe elderly are a large group affected by this. They have many transactions that require contracts: from medical care, to insurance policies, to financial management, and more. This is a group that tends to have trouble following long and complicated contracts. It is also a group that often has difficulty operating technology -- which can be perilous as contracts are increasingly paperless and online.\n\nThat's why we created AgreeAble , a contracts platform that is simple and universally welcoming to everyone. We wanted to make a platform that demystifies contracts for those who have trouble with them, making reading and signing as easy as possible."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"AgreeAble works as follows:\n\n1) A family member or caretaker helps the user set up an account, storing a special \"Visual Key\" as their login instead of a password. This Visual Key makes it easy to verify the user's identity, without having to remember complicated logins.\n\n2) The contract issuer enters a new contract for the individual to sign into the AgreeAble system.\n\n3) The user gets a simple email notification that invites them to sign the contract on the AgreeAble website.\n\n4) The user goes to the website where they can see the terms, validate using their Visual Key, and sign the contract.\n\nThe Visual Key is an important part of making the process easy. Current contract services like DocuSign require logins, which may be difficult for the elderly to remember. We wanted to make the login process as easy as \"showing\" the website something that proves your identity. So, that's what we made the Visual Key: to authenticate, the user just shows the website their favorite, physical object that only they have. (Facial recognition would work just as well, although that IBM service was under maintenance at the time of this hackathon.)\n\nWe wanted signing to be very easy too. That's why we chose DocuSign's Click API, which lets users sign an agreement in a single click. We chose Click over the eSignature API because, by design, the Click API is optimized for as little interaction from the user as possible, which is perfect for our audience. That being said, a future expansion could include integrating autofill into the form, which would be enabled by the eSignature API."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built the website in python using the Django web framework. The server uses IBM Visual Recognition to process users' Visual Key, using the data return to generate a unique fingerprint for that key. We then use DocuSign's Clickwrap interface to display simple clickable contracts, retrieving the correct contract from the stored value in our Django database.\n\nThe Visual Key uses a fingerprint distance for validation; For an object to be considered a valid key, it must look sufficiently close to this fingerprint. Otherwise, it is rejected. This is an interesting use of data because we built this rather accurate fingerprint using standard vision models, without needing specific domain training."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Unfortunately, some services that we had wanted to use were not available at the time of this hackathon. We had wanted to use IBM Visual Recognition's Facial Recognition feature, but it was under maintenance at the time.

The Sia Storage Platform leverages underutilized hard drive capacity around the world to create a data storage marketplace that is more reliable and lower cost than traditional cloud storage providers.\n\nYour data is sliced up, encrypted, and stored on nodes all across the globe to eliminate any single point of failure and ensure the highest possible uptime. Since you hold the keys, you own your data. No outside company can access or control your files."},{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Currently, Siacoin runs on charging the host for bandwidth and storage used for the file. We think this leaves the file especially vulnerable when the host stops watching and paying for the file. Additionally, the host might not have the ability to buy Siacoin quickly. We want to make decentralized storage truly free for all."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"To mitigate this issue, we're creating an ad-supported upload and download web server portal that will allow the file to sustain itself monetarily on the network.\n\nTo use, the user will visit the site, upload the file after watching an ad and then receive a download link as well as their Sia permanent link. They could then disseminate the links to the users who would like to access the file."},{"heading":"Based on these calculations the Sia Cost: (prices as of 9/4/19)","content":"Storage $0.68 / 1TB $6.8E-7/1MB Upload $0.11 /1TB $1.1E-7/1MB Download $0.59 /1TB $5.9E-7/1MB\n\nWe can clearly see that one 30 second video ad ~$0.01 can conservatively handle the price of 1gb of data on a download. One 30 second video ad on upload can also cover close to a year of hosting. One could say this isn't the true cost as explained below but we'll use this as a rough order of magnitude approximation."},{"heading":"Prototype Status:","content":"We tried using a Node.Js server backend to get the files into the Siacoin. We had some difficulties understanding the API and understanding how the Sia daemon uses the Node.Js server to fully do everything we need. Additionally, It was difficult to get the Sia client working.\n\nStill if we got the right configuration working, the upload side of the file would have to go to the web server, then uploaded to Sia. On the reverse side, the file needs to be queried from Sia to the web server, then downloaded to the client. In summary, this increases the bandwidth requirements considerably to use Sia as the final destination which will increase costs.\n\nHowever, there are situations that this could make sense. On fairly small files, few ads could cover all of these costs anyway. One could assert that the bandwidth is the majority cost of the file hosting so this is only useful for mostly cold storage. However, as long as the original Sia path is known, the file is not reliant on the central web server shutting down. This allows the file to stay up indefinitely as multiple client software can still access the file. One could simply recover their password for their Sia files they uploaded and still access them."},{"heading":"What's next for Sustainable Ad-Supported Blockchain File Storage","content":"Of course, this is all in the abstract. Due to difficulties getting the wallet working, much development would have to be done in the future.

Our core technical contributions are a tool that assigns data to the appropriate database based on the input data and a high-level schema for incoming data.\n\nWe demonstrated our approach by building a web app, StockSolver, that shows these trade-offs and the advantages of using 1DB for database selection. It has both time-series data and text data.

From user interviews, every woman has mentioned personal safety as one of their top concerns within a rideshare. About 23% of American women have reported a driver for inappropriate behavior. Many apps have attempted to mitigate this issue by creating rideshare services that may hire only female drivers. However, these apps have quickly gotten shut down due to discrimination laws. Additionally, around 40% of Uber and Lyft drivers are white males, possibly due to the fact that many minorities may feel uncomfortable in certain situations as a driver.

The app will then ask the user if they would like to call 911 to notify them of the driver's actions. Additionally, many of the user interviews we conducted stated that many women prefer to walk around, especially at night, while waiting for a rideshare driver to pick them up for safety concerns. The app provides an option for users to select in order to allow them to walk around while waiting for their rideshare, also notifying the driver of their dynamic location. After selecting a destination, the user will be able to select a driver from a selection of three drivers on the app. On this selection screen, the app details both identity and personality traits of the drivers, so that riders can select drivers they feel comfortable riding with. Users also have the option to provide feedback on their trip afterward, as well as rating the driver on various aspects such as cleanliness, safe driving, and comfort level. The app will also use these ratings to suggest drivers to users that users similar to them rated highly."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built it using Android Studio in Java for full-stack development.

We want to empower these people to be able to have access to relevant information. Our goal is to pioneer technology that prioritizes the needs of displaced persons and tailor software to uniquely address the specific challenges of homelessness."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Most homeless people have basic cell phones with only calling and sms capabilities. Using kiva, they can use their cell phones to leverage technologies previously accessible with the internet. Users are able to text the number attached to kiva and interact with our intelligent chatbot to learn about nearby shelters and obtain directions to head to a shelter of their choice."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used freely available APIs such as Twilio and Google Cloud in order to create the beta version of kiva. We search for nearby shelters using the Google Maps API and communicate formatted results to the user’s cell phone Twilio’s SMS API."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The biggest challenge was figuring out how to best utilize technology to help those with limited resources. It would be unreasonable to expect our target demographic to own smartphones and be able to download apps off the app market like many other customers would. Rather, we focused on providing a service that would maximize accessibility. Consequently, kiva is an SMS chat bot, as this allows the most users to access our product at the lowest cost."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We succeeded in creating a minimum viable product that produced results! Our current model allows for homeless people to find a list of nearest shelters and obtain walking directions. We built the infrastructure of kiva to be flexible enough to include additional capabilities (i.e. weather and emergency alerts), thus providing a service that can be easily leveraged and expanded in the future."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned that intimately understanding the particular needs of your target demographic is important when hacking for social good. Often, it’s easier to create a product and find people who it might apply to, but this is less realistic in philanthropic endeavors. Most applications these days tend to be web focused, but our product is better targeted to people facing homeslessness by using SMS capabilities."},{"heading":"What's next for kiva","content":"Currently, kiva provides information on homeless shelters. We hope to be able to refine kiva to let users further customize their requests. In the future kiva should be able to provide information about other basic needs such as food and clothing. Additionally, we would love to see kiva as a crowdsourced information platform where people could mark certain places as shelter to improve our database and build a culture of alleviating homelessness."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"flask github google-maps python twilio"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com docs.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"open-choreo","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/open-choreo-1wmryo","tagline":"Teaches you how to dance like Bruno Mars and other famous dancers!","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackMIT 2019","hackathon_url":"https://hackmit-2019.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Niantic Augmented Reality Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"opencv","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null},{"name":"websockets","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/websockets"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"opencv python tensorflow websockets"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-17T18:26:17.014010Z"}}
