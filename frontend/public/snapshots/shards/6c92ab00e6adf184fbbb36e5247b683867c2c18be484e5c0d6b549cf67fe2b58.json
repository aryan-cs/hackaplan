The Client, the Server, and the Lua VM's running sand-boxed flora code. These components all needed to communicate in a thread-safe concurrent manner, and these channels+websockets were the primary challenge and presented lots of iterations and interesting debugging. We had some bizarre stuff happening in the terrarium!\n\nBuilding a concurrent system meant that we needed to clean up all the concurrent processes our program created. This was challenging because it is hard to design a system that cleans up after itself when moving so quickly to improve features.\n\nGo is not an ecosystem that our entire team had used prior to this event, but we decided to use it as our server side for it's excellent concurrency story. This meant that half our team was getting mentored on Go best practices as we laid down the framework for Propagate, but by Saturday night we were all able to be productive and confident in the code-base.\n\nFinally, tweaking mechanics to achieve a satisfactory ecological balance was an important challenge as Propagate came together. We wanted the ecosystem to be alive and dynamic, meaning that old plants gradually withered away to make room for young. An interesting mechanic that emerged is the way that plant's tendencies to drop spores in close proximity to themselves lead to \"forests\" of one species"},{"heading":"Going forward","content":"We would like to explore algorithmic iteration of Propagate programs, including generational mechanics and fitness values.

We believe people should have a way of recording incidents of their own, promoting accountability against unlawful acts without the threat of being identified."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Opening the AnonymEyes app allows users to instantly stream low resolution video anonymously from their mobile phone to the AnonymEyes website. There is no local copy of the video, only a remote one. The videos are also location tagged and placed on a map. This data can act as a way of rapidly and discreetly alerting emergency responders while recording valuable information to them at the same time, rather than dialing EMS."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The two main interfaces to AnonymEyes are an Android app that allows the user to instantaneously record and upload a video stream, and a web application for the public to view uploaded videos.\n\nThe default Android video recorder only returns a video file after the 'Stop Record' button is pressed. To achieve near-continuous live video stream, we needed to hack a way around the default API. Frames of the camera preview were taken at a fixed rate and sent via UDP packets to our Java processing server. On the Java server, the frames were compiled into a H.264 mp4 file for cross-compatibility across all web browsers. The video file is then uploaded to a shared file system between the Java server and a Ruby on Rails web server, both running on the same VM on Google Cloud Platform.\n\nTwo requests are made from the Java server to the Rails server to indicate a new stream. An initial request indicates the location of the anonymous user and plots a Google maps marker. A final request is made once the video file is encoded to notify the client to load the HTML5 video.\n\nThe front end built using Angular.js is dynamically updated by listening to a Firebase database."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Hacking a live video stream was a whole challenge in and of itself. It was imperative that the video was uploaded as soon as possible to the remote server due to the nature of our problem. We initially thought of transmitting whole frames of the video via UDP to our Java server. We realized that most network routers do not deal well with packets of size 1000+ bytes, therefore we had to create an algorithm to manually splice the frames into smaller vertical strips of data.\n\nThe second major challenge we ran into was trying to get a Rails websockets configuration working on Google's Cloud Platform (GCP). Since Rails does not natively support websockets (yet), the gem we used creates a standalone Thin server to route websocket activity. After much frustration, we came to the conclusion that GCP was routing websocket traffic to the HTTP server (we were getting an \"unexpected response code: 200 OK\" error, which is quite counterintuitive to begin with). Ultimately, we had to leverage Firebase to simulate websockets/server-side events. We can send regular HTTP requests via Firebase API and listen to changes in the Firebase database on the client side."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We built an entire live video stream protocol (everything but the actual nitty-gritty encoding). We were also able to interface a Java server, a Rails server and mobile events without much difficulty in a short span of 36 hours."},{"heading":"What's next for AnonymEyes","content":"We would like to make this service available for free to the general public."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android angular.js co css3 ffmpeg firebase google-cloud google-compute-engine google-maps html5 java javascript ruby ruby-on-rails"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"anonymeyes.co"}]},{"project_title":"PayMyFace","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/paymyface","tagline":"Pay anything you see.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/295/997/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2015","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2015.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Winner Winner"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"android-studio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio"},{"name":"braintree","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/braintree"},{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"indico","url":null},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"paypal","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/paypal"},{"name":"photoshop","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop"},{"name":"xml","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xml"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We feel that transferring money these days is a very tedious task.

This allows for both a more accessible way for individuals and charities to experiment with Bitcoin, but also for a larger potential pool of users contributing to the mining effort. These funds are funneled and held in Cryptocause's wallet through Coinbase, which we monitor with a Node backend to distribute a threshold of Bitcoin using Coinbase's API's to a charity selected from a database of charities with known Bitcoin addresses. Because Coinbase allows for users to receive Bitcoin without having created an address on the Bitcoin network, charities can also receive the funds by email notification, through which they can get paid directly to their bank account."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The mining script uses HTTP long-polling and RPC on the server to connect to a decentralized, peer-to-peer mining pool that pays out to our Coinbase address. The script itself takes advantage of WebWorkers and multithreading to maximize the computing power we can derive from the browser. We then provided real-time analytics with Epoch , D3.js , and WebSockets connected to our Node backend to give neat insights into the hash rates of the client, the total clients connected, and the pool itself over time. Our stack is hosted on Linode, which also runs bitcoind and P2Pool to manage payouts and statistics. The Node itself is currently using Coinbase's sandbox development environment, but could easily be changed to production should our project attract enough visitors to generate a significant amount of Bitcoin."},{"heading":"Challenges we faced","content":"One of our primary challenges was forking Hamiyoca , which provided a starting place for being able to mine Bitcoin from the browser. Being an unmaintained repository, we had to go through the repo and fix bugs in the backend that were related to now-deprecated browser technologies (we plan on submitting a good amount of pull requests in the near future). Another challenge we faced was finding an initial mining pool that supported an older mining protocol called getblocktemplate , as we did not have the time to implement Stratum-based browser mining during the 36 hours."},{"heading":"What's next for Cryptocause","content":"For the future, we're planning on maximizing the efficiency of a browser-based Bitcoin miner with Chrome's Native Client in order to be able to tap into lower-level technologies like GPU shaders.

We want to incorporate even more charities into our app and more detailed statistics on each region that can be updated live with local news integration and disaster donation alerts."},{"heading":"Built With","content":".co android braintree github html java javascript json-api urthecast world-bank-data"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"HappyHour","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/happyhour","tagline":"Don't lose track of the night.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/295/817/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2015","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2015.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Uber API"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"pebble","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pebble"},{"name":"squarespace","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/squarespace"},{"name":"twilio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio"},{"name":"uber","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/uber"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/ruthjohnson95/HappyHour"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"For students away at universities, it has become more important than ever to know how to take care of oneself. As college students, we are exposed to a variety of things, including alcohol. Even though we've all had educational classes or seminars in school about drinking safely, sometimes a gentle reminder can make a huge difference. That's where we came up with the idea of HappyHour , a pebble app that can keep you safe."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"HappyHour initially asks users for a couple of inputs: height, weight, and gender. These parameters will be used to calculate the blood-alcohol-content (BAC). BAC is a universal measurement of the alcohol in an individual's system. It is a complex equation that our application simplified for each individual personally.\n\nFrom then onwards, users can specify a '+' or a '-' button, allowing them to keep track of how many drinks they've had with a click of a button. The BAC accordingly updates and creates a vibration, reminding them about their drinks. When the BAC is above 0.08 (the legal threshold for drunk driving), HappyHour creates a longer vibration, indicating that the user should take an Uber home. A click on the select button will trigger an http request that the pebble sends to our node.js server, where we use Uber and Twilio API to text the user information on the nearest Uber, time required to take them home, and estimated price."},{"heading":"Challenges We ran into","content":"Developing on Pebble Time was a learning curve at some points, especially when we were having trouble uploading color resources and performing GET http requests to send longitude and latitude data."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that We are proud of","content":"We are definitely proud of parsing through the Uber JSON API data, as well as setting up Pebble Time to perform GET XMLHttp requests and extract information from that to obtain the geographic coordinates of the Pebble. The entire process of getting user-selected data and displaying the BAC in real time was also difficult, but we've learned a lot in the process!"},{"heading":"What's next for HappyHour","content":"We hope to clean up the user interface code a bit (it's difficult to have good coding habits at hackathons!). We also hope to be releasing the app for othesrs to see and use."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"node.js pebble squarespace twilio uber"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:52:54.291217Z"}}
