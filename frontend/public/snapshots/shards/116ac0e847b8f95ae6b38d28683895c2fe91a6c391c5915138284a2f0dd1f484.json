Drones are known to eliminate the potential for human casualty or injury in dangerous situations. These hazard possibilities were our main inspiration for this project. We began to brainstorm how we can take the capabilities of drone technology and elevate it to better serve the community and be applied across all business and event areas. One area of engineering that has peaked our team's interest in the past is the idea of SWARM robotics. We used this interest to our benefit and started researching ways to apply SWARM techniques to drones and robots sharing their data on the same server.\n\nUsing SWARM techniques could allow drones to perform higher-level tasks, create wider search areas, and act more efficiently. Our example shows how this technology could be applied to natural disasters. Natural disasters destroy communities, wreck homes, tear families apart, and kill wildlife and natural environments. Having grown up in an era with so many of these disasters happening around the world, we watched the wreckage of national and international communities alike on TV. In 2014, a natural disaster hit a bit closer to home for one of our team members when Hurricane Sandy stomped through the Northeast. This didn't compare to disasters such as Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, but she experienced the terrifying high winds, heavy rain, strong lightning strikes. She got to witness large trees falling on her friends homes, tide surges sweeping homes into the ocean, and mass power outages. In larger and more devastating disasters, there are times when people get stuck in their homes, no one knows where they are so no one can come save them, and the wrecked environment is too dangerous to actively search for survivors via pure human power. With the use of surveillance drones and terrain robotics, people could be saved from these disasters in shorter time and more efficiently without putting rescue teams directly at risk.\n\nOur hack also allows for tracking vehicles with image recognition. Our image processing software can detect stopped vehicles on the sides of the road and send location data to local towing companies to increase efficiency and reduce traffic time."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We wanted to elevate this idea with SWARM techniques so that we could create a large IoT System combining AR Parrot Elite Drones and robotics that could collaborate to accomplish tasks in places where people can't safely go. Although this technology could be be applied across many unique scenarios, we focused on using it for rescue in natural disasters.\n\nTwo drones and a terrain-based robot are connected through a server and assigned tasks based on gesture controls given by a user through Kinect v2 sensors. The user can control the series of mobile devices from a safe location with hand/finger based movements that are recognized by our finger tracking system. The user can tell the drones to start hovering and then direct them through certain paths by moving his hands in specified directions. Using image recognition and body detection through OpenCV, the drones are able to locate survivors in need of rescue.\n\nThis is where SWARM concepts are used to expand the capabilities of our technology. With drones flying synchronously together over specific environments, once they detect someone on their surveillance systems, one of the drones could break off from the rest of the swarm and use beacons to emit their current location for a ground team to come and find the located survivor. This can be performed autonomously by terrain based rovers or by personnel based rescue teams. This way, they aren't actively searching for survivors and risking their lives in dangerous areas not even knowing if there is anyone to save, they will be able to go to specific locations right away, retrieve the survivor in a more efficient time, and get everyone back to safety. Meanwhile, the rest of the drone swarm continues surveillance of the area continuing to locate survivors and perform the same instructions once body detection is confirmed."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"The drones are programmed using a Python based API that assigns controls, directions, and turn angles to specific functions. This backend was then used to assign gesture controls to directions of the collaborative drone system. Gesture control system is operated using the Microsoft v2 Kinect Sensor for Windows. Through the integration of a Finger Tracking API with the Microsoft Kinect for Windows v2 SDK, we can detect finger specific and hand specific gestures that are used to provide the drone instructions.\n\nOnce the drone is airborne, the gesture control system continues to provide directional commands to the swarm until the image recognition and body detection software running through OpenCV detects a human figure in the surveillance area below. At this point, a positive body detection output will cause the drone to follow the object with of positive detection. The rest of the drone swarm will continue to perform surveillance in the same manner."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Our original idea depended on the integration of Myo technology to recognize hand motion and other gestures. Once we got to HackGT, we found out the Myo wasn't available through the supplied hardware lab, so we had to brainstorm different ways to track hand gestures. We decided on Microsoft Kinect sensors for body detection and then we were able to find finger tracking APIs to integrate with the Kinect SDKs, but this was technology that we hadn't used before, so there was more of a learning curve than expected.\n\nOur biggest challenge was networking between a Microsoft Kinect for PC, a Dell XPS, a Macbook Air, and a Parrot Drone. In order to send the drone commands, the Mac had to be connected to the Drone's wifi as well as a different wifi network that could be used to receive the gesture commands from the PC. The network was unable to do this, so after much collaboration and brainstorming, we connected the two laptops with USB to Ethernet cables."},{"heading":"What's next for SWARM Drones","content":"SWARM Drones can truly be applied in so many different and unique scenarios. This technology could not only be applied in natural disasters, but it could be use to provide surveillance over car crashes, find missing or lost people in wildlife reserves, track broken down cars on highways and emit locations to nearby towing and auto repair companies, or help research hard to reach terrains."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"adobe-illustrator all-things-microsoft<3 azure c# caffeine finger-tracking-api flask jetbrains microsoft-kinect mlh-prime-usb-adapters namecheap opencv photoshop ps-drone-api pubnub pycharm python-2.7 visual-studio windows-movie-maker"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"GM OnStar Gas Station Finder","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/gas","tagline":"This app will automatically find the cheapest and nearest gas station from OnStar data when the fuel is low.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/415/142/datas/medium.jpeg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2016.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Auto Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/4n3ver/gas"},{"label":"ec2-54-208-31-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com","url":"http://ec2-54-208-31-80.compute-1.amazonaws.com:7000/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"When we're driving and our gas is running out, we don't want to look at our phone to find the nearest gas station.

At the time of this writing the data set that we are working with is ~52,000 projects and ~72,000 Github contributors to these hackathon projects.\n\nWe begin by grabbing all of this data, then building a best-fit linear model to it, and then allow you to make some predictions upon which you can test their viability.\n\nYou can read about the rest on Github."},{"heading":"Things we Learned","content":"TensorFlow is really hard."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"amazon-web-services python scikit-learn tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"EasyGate","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/easygate","tagline":"Minimizes boarding time at the gate and ensures on time departures by predicting and preventing overhead bin overflow","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/414/892/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2016.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Air Travel Solutions"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"api","url":null},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"cv2","url":null},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"json","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/json"},{"name":"numpy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy"},{"name":"opencv","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"socket.io","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/socket-io"},{"name":"threading","url":null},{"name":"udp","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/sangchankim/EasyGate"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As frequent flyers, we often witness situations in which passengers unknowingly bring aboard carry-on items just as overhead storage is reaching its capacity. As a result, both the passenger and crew have to scramble to get the luggage back out of the plane and checked to the passenger's final destination. Not only does this cause the poor passenger some embarrassment but it can also lead to untimely departures and feelings of discontent among other passengers. However, this is neither the passenger's nor the gate agent's fault: there currently is no method or technology to help the gate agent estimate when he/she should start checking larger bags in at the gate."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"As boarding starts, a Delta gate agent can use To minimize boarding time, we use image recognition to identify the types of luggage (bag, backpack, suitcase, etc.) each passenger possesses. Multiple camera streams can be used and processed in real time in order to accurately identify and account for each passenger's luggage. Once the type of luggage is known, an estimation of its dimension is used to calculate the amount of space it will take in the overhead compartments. As the overhead capacity fills up, the gate agent can monitor the capacity status on his/her monitor and make smart decisions about whether or not a bag should be checked in."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We have a Flask web app in which a Delta gate agent can enter the flight number and see a progress bar of the overhead bin capacity. As the gate agent scans the boarding passenger's ticket, the scanned customer's info (name, seat, destination) will appear on the ticket agent's screen and the computer vision system (utilizing OpenCV and Microsoft's Cognitive Services Computer Vision API) will count and categorize and count the passenger's luggage in real-time. Our Flask back-end communicates back and forth with our front-end with Socket.io. In addition, multiple camera feeds are supported through the use of parallelized threads. We also used UDP message sending to send a \"ticket scanned\" message from the gate agent (web app) to the cameras and computer vision system (flask backend). We created a Rest API post method to pass the types of luggages back to the webpage for visualization."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of the biggest challenges was figuring out a reasonable method for identifying and categorizing the carry-on luggage. At first, we were going to use blob tracking and potentially background removal techniques order to define regions of interest and minimize noise. However, it soon became apparent that there were limitations Window's Cognitive Services Computer Vision API and that enhancing the pictures did little to boost the accuracy of the tags and descriptions generated by the API. We also had some trouble figuring out how to send messages back and forth between the flask socket and the computer vision system. Eventually we settled for using UDP message sending and a Rest API to transfer the data."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We were able to run live streams of videos from our phones, onto the web and into our computer vision system for real-time analysis. We had a lot of fun wandering around the building and calling the Computer Vision API to describe all kinds of situations found at the Hackathon. In addition, our program is only bottlenecked by the Window's API call and doesn't add any additional time to the boarding process. If each ticket takes about 3 seconds to process and display on the gate agent's monitor, by the time the ticket information is ready, our program will have already categorized their luggage and made an appropriate suggestion to the gate agent regarding checking-in the passenger's luggage."},{"heading":"What's next for EasyGate","content":"The next big step for EasyGate involves machine learning and running a k-means clustering algorithm to categorize harder and more complex luggages. While the Window's API is capable of amazing object detection and environmental descriptions, it is not able to differentiate between closely related items and it often over-tags the picture with unnecessary descriptions. Running a machine learning model on the incoming data would allow the system to accurately differentiate between small hand bags and bulky duffel bags and thus, a better estimate of the items size. In addition, figuring out the optimal way of positioning the bags in the overhead bins would also help cut down on unused space on the plane. similar situations and has trouble"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api css cv2 flask html javascript json numpy opencv python socket.io threading udp"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Haptic Movies","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/haptic-movies","tagline":"Videos and Experiences You Can Touch","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/415/381/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 2016","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2016.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most innovative use of TanvasTouch in a digital experience"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"opencv","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"tanvas","url":null},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/sarthaksrinivas/haptic-movies"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We wanted to enable rich multi–sensory three–dimensional experiences within the affordances of existing two dimensional touchscreen technology.

With this product, your recordings of your trip to Italy would become an entirely more immersive experience. Imagine looking at a video of the colosseum and being able to feel the rough concrete structure of its walls with the tips of your fingers or the soft,suave feeling of its outer marble columns. This application would definitely change the way in which travel is experienced, enabling travelers to remember much more about the beloved places in which they visited. Not only that, it would enable people that have never been to notorious landmarks to have a more intimate experience with those beautiful places, allowing them to not only observe those places but also touch them and feel them"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The main technology that drives this forward is Deep Learning and Artifical Intelligence, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks. Advanced deep neural nets are now able to perform really well in a task called Semantic segmentation. It involves looking at different images and identifying the individual objects in actors present in it. After doing so, it draws a bounding box around those objects, giving us an idea on the exact placement of an object, animal or feature in an image.\n\nThis technology is perfect for a company like Tanvas. By being able to name and identify objects and agents in a video, this enables us to create multiple different tactile sensations to different objects. This algorithm could easily learn how to recognize a cow in a plantation, for example. Then, we could associate a particular haptic feeling to the cow, enabling people to feel how fluffy they are. This method could easily be applied to any elements in a video and it only becomes better as it’s used, since more data equals more knowledge when it comes to deep nets. Given the absurdly large amount of videos in the internet, it wouldn’t be a far cry to create models that could crawl through those videos, label and segment the objects present on those and learn to associate objects with different haptic sensations. Those sensations could be learned programatically, through user feedback or even through natural language processing in the future. Understanding which objects have word representations that are closer to “sandy” or “rocky” could give you an edge on associating different tactile feelings to different objects\n\nDuring hack GT, we attempted to get those object segmentation regions and match them to different haptic bitmaps of different magnitudes. This would be a simple way of attributing different touch sensations to different regions and concepts. After that, we would render a video clip with around 600 frames matched with different haptic bitmaps representing the object.\n\nThe haptic bitmaps were generated through the use of gaussian noise distributions. We chose to represent animals and humans with a higher mean/lower variance gaussian, to give a stronger sense of touch to them. Secondary objects that could add to the experience were associated to gaussians with lower means."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The main issue arose from the time taken to train deep models. However, as it can be seen from our demo, it is possible to create a simple demonstration of this concept through the use of simple edge detectors allied with some sem–automated coloring. It wouldn’t be a stretch to build a Semantic Segmentation deep net that could do this automatically if we were given more time. Here, in this final image, we show some of the bitmaps for one video frame. Notice how one of the haptic blobs surrounds the castle in the background and how the more noisy blob surrounds the photographer"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"In the end, this was a great hackathon and we definitely learned a lot.
