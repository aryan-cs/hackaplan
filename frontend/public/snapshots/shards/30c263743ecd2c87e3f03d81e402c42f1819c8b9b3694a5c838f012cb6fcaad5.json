The four features that are currently added are a math problem generator, a custom quiz generator, a calculator, and a geography quiz."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"These are four mini-projects I knew I could make and I combined them to remove the hassle of many websites and many accounts. I built my projects on Repl.it using Python for the many apps I had to code many different functions which took a lot of time but was successful in the end. Throughout building an app with many features like this one I have faced many challenges, and I will note some of the major ones."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"While creating the random math problem generator, I had no idea how to create a variable to save the answer. After a lot of testing someone on Stackoverflow said to use the evaluate function and after doing more research about how to use it was able to apply it. During the custom quiz generator, there was way too much text on the screen making everything hard to read in the console. After a lot of research, I learned you could either use the clear os function and then I used the os function, but I also used clear later just because I wanted to learn how to use it for myself. After this, I wanted to create a return-to-home function this led to a problem since I wanted to go back to the original screen but then I started facing a problem due to one of the variables in this function being a local variable then I started researching this and learned or had to state it as a global variable which I did and fixed the problem."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I am proud of","content":"I am very proud that I was able to bring four already difficult mini-projects into one major product which was able to do all the functionalities of the four mini-projects.

In Blackjack, players aim to get a hand value as close to 21 as possible without going over, while in Subtraction Showdown, players aim to subtract their way to zero. Both games require careful consideration of the current state and potential outcomes."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"It's a number guessing game. Players either have to guess the number outright or have to subtract their way down to zero. With each subtraction, you get closer to your target but also farther from knowing the exact starting number. Along the way you can get hints or know the total subtracted to track your progress."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"I used core functions like input/output, loops, and conditionals in python. The logic behind the game involves random number generation, user input processing, and win/loss conditions. I felt the need to include hints, scorekeeping, and replay-ability to keep the user engaged, but not get overwhelmed."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"While coding, I had to pay attention to detail to be sure that the code could interpret different user inputs and provide the appropriate responses. Trying to balance the challenge level and player experience was something I didn't think about until I ran user tests. My biggest hurdle was overcoming invalid errors that popped up, and learning how to prevent the game from crashing."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"I'm proud to have been able to code and create this game!"},{"heading":"What's next for Subtraction Showdown","content":"Next in this, I want to implement a mobile version.

Is it possible to define the boundaries of this super-structure? These are commonly thought of questions, however, always left unanswered due to the vastness and of course, the complexity of the universe. This interest brought forth our idea to combine our love for coding and dark matter. AstroVerse was inspired by our aspirations to make this information accessible to everyone and present it engagingly. We aim to organize AstroVerse in a way that piques the interest of the young and ignites the curiosity surrounding the cosmos, hence, empowering the study of a really vast branch of physics, i.e., Astronomy."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"What better way to engage an audience than a dynamic website? AstroVerse is an education website that provides information on cosmic structures and their properties, formation, and evolution.

Moreover, we have added a list of references for future exploration!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"AstroVerse was constructed based on a ton of research, covering all the aspects of dark matter, clusters of galaxies, and more (Of course, the research included YouTube) . It was a grueling task to find out the different features and ways to increase user engagement. We went through almost all the information that we could find on our selected topic to present the perfect research."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of our biggest challenges included aligning our interests with the databases. Using highly complex astrophysics and simplifying and refining was time-consuming. It was also important to create a visually appealing website that would attract users which caused some issues on the technical front. In addition, there appears to be a question mark regarding the legitimacy of the presence of dark matter."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Learning is a constant process in this field, especially when combined with an interesting topic like astrophysics. From using HTML to create more than a static website to dark matter, we gained a lot by attending this hackathon and building it from scratch."},{"heading":"What's next for AstroVerse","content":"If given the opportunity, we would like to use 3D simulations with more interactive and dynamic features which would also help our younger audiences feel more comfortable using the website.
