As demonstrated by Apple’s recent removal of the Taiwanese flag emoji and HK Maps from its platforms, the state often uses their power to curtail access to content it deems reprehensible. This makes platforms extremely vulnerable to censorship, as they can be easily banned. For example, Signal and Tor are less than effective in China because they can be blocked by the state.\n\nTo get around this problem, one needs to be able to send secret messages in a way that observers cannot detect. If the state can see that a secret message is being sent, they can block it or begin targeting the sender. To this end, we present Stegasaurus. With Stegasaurus users can embed encrypted text into otherwise benign images and post those to any content hosting platform.\n\nStegasaurus uses an OpenPGP encryption scheme and a research-informed method for text embedding that is resistant to JPEG compression. Stegasaurus is careful to encode secret messages into images in a way that is both resistant to statistical attacks and imperceptible to the human eye. As a result, a person with a copy of Stegasaurus can embed text into an innocuous selfie, post it on a platform like WeChat, and secretly encode a message to anyone who has a public PGP key."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Stegasaurus intentionally avoids dependencies on external libraries for the sake of portability and platform agnosticity. We imagine it being used in a world where access to libraries and other tools may be extremely censored. Under the hood, Stegasaurus runs in a web browser. Its backend server is written entirely in standard library python and it's only external dependencies are OpenCV and Numpy. In the future, we’d like to port Stegasaurus to Javascript so that literally anyone with a web browser can run it."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Encoding text in JPEG images is very difficult as JPEG employs a lossy compression scheme. Stegasaurus supports JPEG though by embedding text in the coefficients of the DCT of an image. In order to encode text into JPEG images, Stegasaurus performs the DCT over 8x8 pixel blocks in the image. It then encodes text according to the relationship between the coefficients in the DCT. This work isn’t in the main branch of Stegasaurus yet, but it is working in the zeke-DCT branch."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"It works, and it's pretty.

However, NVIDIA's model was trained on the CelebA network, and thus is not an unbiased sample as it favors certain groups of people over others.

There was a need for a device to protect protestors then, and there's a need for it now.\n\nEspecially in light of many more protests occurring in the world, most notably currently in Hong Kong, Chile, and Lebanon, we wanted to build something that would leverage the power of the crowd to keep these brave people safe.\n\nWe introduce CrowdVision.io, a hardware/software smart-glass hack combining the power of having numbers on the ground and an eye in the sky."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our platform assumes the fact that many protestors are onboarded with our device and website. Each protestor wears a set of glasses that are decked out with infrared lights, vibration motors, and a camera. The smart-glass' infrared lights are meant to block out CCTV cameras so that protesters can avoid being persecuted for participating. We used a lightweight SqueezeNet deep learning model to help the smart-glasses recognize something violent or potentially threatening (for example if soldiers with guns show up or there is tear gas in the air). The glasses could recognize the danger and alert a web server which registers the potential threat on a map. Immediately, all other protesters in the network within a specified radius of danger are alerted using vibrations in their glasses so they can act fast to combat the danger. The intensity of glass vibration here will be proportional to the closeness of a protester to danger. Moreover, everyone in the area receives a push-notification so they can immediately take action.\n\nOn the web application side, we maintain a map of all \"danger incidents\" near the user's location as well as a running notification bar that provides information regarding the state of the general area."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We scavenged a pair of sponsor sunglasses, and started adding our own gear to it. Our motors and infrared lights are controlled by an Arduino while the camera data is processed on our laptop, which contains our deep learning model.

This web server can communicate with all the users and alert protester devices."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This was anything but a smooth Hackathon. Originally, we wanted to mount a camera on a Raspberry. We spent hours trying to install Raspbian on a headless Pi, only to be reward with a barrage of SD card read errors.

We decided to run SqueezeNet out of the box and create additional metrics for measuring the danger in the region.\n\nWe originally wanted to run our app in React, but none of us had to React knowledge. This led to many problems along the way, especially since we were trying to incorporate a Firebase server into our protocol. Finally, during a last-minute pivot, we overhauled the entire stack and decided to use PHP instead."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"This was a massive project in scale involving deep learning, full-stack development, hardware, and design.

Even though some obstacles prevailed, we persevered and ended up with a really cool project."},{"heading":"What's next for CrowdVision.io","content":"There are definitely many more features we can implement. If we had more time, we could train a more custom machine learning model to more accurately determine the situation. We plan to use a small powerful computer like a Raspberry Pi or a Jetson Nano that can fit in well with the design of the smart glasses to eliminate the need for wires. Additionally, we plan to implement a clustering algorithm related to the density of danger points that could use a blockchain-like consenus protocol. For example, if many reports of danger showed up on the map, then with higher probability we could conclude that danger did exist there and decrease the number of false alarms.\n\nFinally, there are so many other potential applications for smart-glasses like these. For example, in a construction setting or a warehouse, perhaps the glasses could be trained to identify risk areas that people may not recognize and mark those areas as unsafe when people approach them."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino deep-learning firebase javascript php python pytorch react real-time-object-detection webcam"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"VATT","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/vatt","tagline":"Video to Video Language Processing","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Cal Hacks Fellowship Program"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"crepe","url":null},{"name":"cv2","url":null},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"moviepy","url":null},{"name":"numpy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"tensorflow","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/crystal-zq-wang/VATT"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"crepe cv2 google-cloud moviepy numpy python tensorflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"BlackRock API: Investment Portfolio Diversity Visualizer","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/ch19","tagline":"Investment portfolio diversity visualization tool, utilizing BlackRock Security Data API","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/872/489/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"BlackRock API Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/richardszhu/ch19"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"To Use:","content":"Load the GUI by running vis3.py"},{"heading":"Resources Used","content":"http://rockthecode.io/api/ https://www.blackrock.com/tools/api-tester/hackathon?apiType=securityData"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"PocketAnalyst","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/pocketanalyst","tagline":"PocketAnalyst puts the brain of financial analysts in your pocket to help you navigate the world of financial markets.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/871/125/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Goldman Sachs"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"blackrock","url":null},{"name":"dialogflow","url":null},{"name":"docusign","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/docusign"},{"name":"goldman-sachs","url":null},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/canxkoz/PocketAnalyst"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We're all told that stocks are a good way to diversify our investments, but taking the leap into trading stocks is daunting.

The name of each folder is the category that the pictures inside of it belong to. The backend will take the folder and transfer it into a CSV file. From this CSV file it creates a Pytorch.utils.Dataset Class by inheriting Dataset and overriding three of its methods. When the dataset is ready, the data is augmented using a combination of 6 different augmentations: CenterCrop, ColorJitter, RandomAffine, RandomRotation, and Normalize. By doing those transformations, we ~10x the amount of data that we have for training. Once the data is in a CSV file and has been augmented, we are ready for training. We import SqueezeNet and use transfer learning to adjust it to our categories. What this means is that we erase the last layer of the original net, which was originally trained for ImageNet (1000 categories), and initialize a layer of size equal to the number of categories that the user defined, making sure to accurately match dimensions. We then run back-propagation on the network with all the weights “frozen” in place with exception to the ones in the last layer. As the model is training, it is informing the front-end that progress being made, allowing us to display a progress bar.

On top of Python we used torch, torch.nn as nn, torch.optim as optim, torch.optim import lr_scheduler, numpy as np, torchvision, from torchvision import datasets, models, and transforms, import matplotlib.pyplot as plt, import time, import os, import copy, import json, import sys."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Going into this, we were not sure if 36 hours were enough to build this product. The proudest moment of this project was the successful testing round at 1am on Sunday. While we had some machine learning experience on our team, none of us had experience with transfer learning or this sort of web application. At the beginning of our project, we sat down, learned about each task, and then drew a diagram of our project. We are especially proud of this step because coming into the coding portion with a clear API functionality understanding and delegated tasks saved us a lot of time and helped us integrate the final product."},{"heading":"Obstacles we overcame and what we learned","content":"Machine learning models are often finicky in their training patterns. Because our application allows users with little experience, we had to come up with a robust training pipeline. Designing this pipeline took a lot of thought and a few failures before we converged on a few data augmentation techniques that do the trick. After this hurdle, integrating a deep learning backend with the website interface was quite challenging, as the training pipeline requires very specific labels and file structure. Iterating the website to reflect the rigid protocol without over complicating the interface was thus a challenge. We learned a ton over this weekend. Firstly, getting the transfer learning to work was enlightening as freezing parts of the network and writing a functional training loop for specific layers required diving deep into the pytorch API. Secondly, the human-design aspect was a really interesting learning opportunity as we had to come up with the right line between abstraction and functionality. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, constantly meeting and syncing code taught us the importance of keeping a team on the same page at all times."},{"heading":"What's next for Flash Computer Vision","content":"Application companion + Machine Learning on the Edge\n\nWe want to build a companion app with the same functionality as the website. The companion app would be even more powerful than the website because it would have the ability to quantize models (compression for ml) and to transfer them into TensorFlow Lite so that models can be stored and used within the device. This would especially benefit people in developing countries, where they sometimes cannot depend on having a cellular connection.\n\nCharge to use\n\nWe want to make a payment system within the website so that we can scale without worrying about computational cost. We do not want to make a business model out of charging per API call, as we do not believe this will pave a path forward for rapid adoption. We want users to own their models, this will be our competitive differentiator. We intentionally used a smaller neural network to reduce hosting and decrease inference time. Once we compress our already small models, this vision can be fully realized as we will not have to host anything, but rather return a mobile application."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"javascript node.js python pytorch"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"flash-cv.com"}]},{"project_title":"Guardian","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/guardian-wo284r","tagline":"Safer together","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/870/283/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"rideOS API Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"google-maps","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps"},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"pandas","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pandas"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"rideos","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"docs.google.com","url":"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1VEahjw_0BUlE4TE32_qgnG3OetoZ2zxpQV0uqzoZ2uE/edit?usp=sharing"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/kevin-j-yu/guardian"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Introduction","content":"For many Berkeley students, walking home late at night or at odd hours always carries a certain risk unique to other colleges.

We focused on the underserved community of deaf or hard-of-hearing students, who communicate, understand, and think primarily in ASL. While some of these students have become accustomed to reading English in various contexts, our market research from studies conducted by Penn State University indicates that members of the community prefer to communicate and think in ASL, and think of English writing as a second language in terms of grammatical structure and syntax.\n\nThe majority of deaf people do not have what is commonly referred to as an “inner voice”; instead they often sign ASL in their heads to themselves. For this reason, deaf students are largely disadvantaged in academia, especially with regard to live attendance of lectures. As a result, we sought to design an app to translate professors’ lecture speeches to ASL in near-real time."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our app enables enhanced live-lecture for members of the ASL-speaking community by intelligently converting the professor's speech to a sequence of ASL videos for the user to watch during lecture. This style of real-time audio to ASL conversion has never been done before, and our app bridges the educational barrier that exists in the deaf and hard-of-hearing community."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We broke down the development of the app into 3 phases: converting voice to speech, converting speech to ASL videos, and connecting the two components together in an iOS application with an engaging user interface.\n\nBuilding off of existing on-device speech recognition models including Pocketsphinx, Mozilla DeepSpeech, iOS Dictation, and more, we decided to combine them in an ensemble model. We employed the Google Cloud Speech to Text API to transcribe videos for ground truth, against which we compared transcription error rates for our models by phonemes, lengths, and syllabic features.\n\nFinally, we ran our own tests to ensure that the speech-to-text API was dynamically editing previously spoken words and phrases using context of neighboring words. The ideal weights for each weight assigned to each candidate were optimized over many iterations of testing using the Weights & Biases API (along with generous amounts of freezing layers and honing in!). Through many grueling rounds and head-to-head comparisons, the iOS on-device speech recognizer shined, with its superior accuracy and performance, compared to the other two, and was assigned the highest weight by far. Based on these results, in order to improve performance, we ended up not using the other two models at all."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"When we were designing the solution architecture, we quickly discovered there was no API or database to enable conversion of written English to ASL \"gloss\" (or even videos). We were therefore forced to make our own database by creating and cropping videos ourselves. While time-consuming, this ensured consistent video quality as well as speed and efficiency in loading the videos on the iOS device. It also inspired our plan to crowdsource information and database video samples from users in a way that benefits all those who opt-in to the sharing system.\n\nOne of the first difficulties we had was navigating the various different speech recognition model outputs and modifying it for continuous and lengthy voice samples. Furthermore, we had to ensure our algorithm dynamically adjusted history and performed backwards error correction, since some API's (especially Apple's iOS Dictation) dynamically alter past text when clued in on context from later words.\n\nAll of our lexical and syntactical analysis required us to meticulously design finite state machines and data structures around the results of the models and API's we used — and required significant alteration & massaging — before they became useful for our application. This was necessary due to our ambitious goal of achieving real-time ASL delivery to users."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As a team we were most proud of our ability to quickly learn new frameworks and use Machine Learning and Reinforcement Learning to develop an application that was scalable and modular. While we were subject to a time restriction, we ensured that our user interface was polished, and that our final app integrated several frameworks seamlessly to deliver a usable product to our target audience, sans bugs or errors. We pushed ourselves to learn unfamiliar skills so that our solution would be as comprehensive as we could make it. Additionally, of course, we’re proud of our ability to come together and solve a problem that could truly benefit an entire community."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to brainstorm ideas effectively and in a team, create ideas collaboratively, and parallelize tasks for maximum efficiency. We exercised our literature research and market research skills to recognize that there was a gap we could fill in the ASL community. We also integrated ML techniques into our design and solution process, carefully selecting analysis methods to evaluate candidate options before proceeding on a rigorously defined footing. Finally, we strove to continually analyze data to inform future design decisions and train our models."},{"heading":"What's next for Sign-ify","content":"We want to expand our app to be more robust and extensible. Currently, the greatest limitation of our application is the limited database of ASL words that we recorded videos for. In the future, one of our biggest priorities is to dynamically generate animation so that we will have a larger and more accurate database. We want to improve our speech to text API with more training data so that it becomes more accurate in educational settings.\n\nPublishing the app on the iOS app store will provide the most effective distribution channel and allow members of the deaf and hard-of-hearing community easy access to our app.\n\nWe are very excited by the prospects of this solution and will continue to update the software to achieve our goal of enhancing the educational experience for users with auditory impairments."},{"heading":"Citations:","content":"Google Cloud Platform API\n\nPenn State. \"Sign language users read words and see signs simultaneously.\" ScienceDaily.

Their database offering distinguishes itself by being able to perform atomic transactions on highly distributed clusters. Cockroach.db was the perfect database service for Change to use because our financial transaction data is incredibly sensitive and we need a fault tolerant way to store it.\n\nBecause of the nature of Change's data, we knew we had to avoid bugs in our storage. For example, there are multiple queries that need to happen when a user pays a store on Change: it needs to log the payment, update the balance of the customer, and update the balance of the store. If our database query were to fail in a non atomic way, we could have crippling data desync bugs. We used Cockroach.db to make sure that didn't happen."},{"heading":"links","content":"backend: http://github.com/churst12/change-backend mobile: http://github.com/VaughnFisher/Change_Mobile desktop POS: http://github.com/darrendawson/changePOS"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroach.db expo.io flask python react-native react.js sql"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Dodge The React","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dodge-the-react","tagline":"Avoid all the angry reacts!","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/871/548/datas/medium.PNG","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Cockroach Labs API Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"a-frame","url":null},{"name":"cockroachdb","url":null},{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"webvr","url":null},{"name":"windows-mixed-reality","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/andrewhlu/gridiron-gauntlet"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"a-frame cockroachdb express.js node.js webvr windows-mixed-reality"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Drovo","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/drovo","tagline":"Drovo applies machine learning to vehicle data to give you feedback on your driving skills","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/870/490/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 6.0","hackathon_url":"https://cal-hacks-6.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Ford Motor Company"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android"},{"name":"flaticon","url":null},{"name":"ford","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ford"},{"name":"fordsync3","url":null},{"name":"java","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/java"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"sdl","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sdl"},{"name":"smartdevicelink","url":null},{"name":"tcp","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/tcp"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"How did you feel when you first sat behind the driving wheel?

That being said, driver safety in vehicles for a lower level of autonomy is critical and is therefore currently our top priority in the near future. Numerous accidents have occurred due to the driver's inattentiveness caused by his/her drowsiness. So we thought, why not make a safety system integrated to the car's infotainment system such that it takes care of the driver's concentration on the road and also improves the mental and emotional state of mind before and during driving, making it a more safe and comfortable one. Also, who doesn't like personalized entertainment options?"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our software detects drowsiness of the driver, by constantly monitoring Eyes-Aspect-Ratio (EAR), and if it goes below a threshold and is maintained below for a certain duration of time, a voice alert is sent to the in-car infotainment system. The frequency and intensity of the alerts increase until the person is woken up by the alerts. The infotainment system also recommends nearby places for refreshments which include cafes', restaurants, rest areas, hotels along the distance once the driver becomes attentive after the constant voice and sound alerts for him/her to rejuvenate. In addition, the software constantly monitors the driver's face to detect the emotions and based on these emotions, it recommends songs that can be added to the playlist queue, thereby personalizing the ride for the driver and co-passengers."},{"heading":"How we built","content":"The entire software focuses on two main issues which include driver's drowsiness and emotion detection. We use OpenCV and a pre-trained ResNet-18 model to predict the Eyes-Aspect-Ratio (EAR) from the continuous video feed of the driver's face, based on which the Drowsiness is detected. The car's GPS coordinates are extracted from the Ford SDL API and are provided to the Google Map's Places API, which recommends the top 3 nearest rest-stops on the route along with the distance from the current location. Google Cloud Vision API's pre-trained face detection was employed to detect emotions on the same video feed used for drowsiness detection. We integrated these on the Ford's SmartDeviceLink (SDL) backend API. Once the drowsiness detector is triggered, it sets off the voice alerts which go on until the driven is awake, and once this is detected by the drowsiness detector, it sends a signal to the Places API, which provides the distance to the rest-stops and is displayed on the infotainment console. While this is happening, the emotions of the driver are constantly monitored and songs are recommended based on the emotions. We generated three different playlists for three different emotions i.e Joy, Sad and Neutral for the initial tests using Spotify's Music API, and these playlists are created in such a way that it suggests songs which lift up the emotion of the driver if he/she is detected to be sad, and not play songs which makes him/her dwell in it. These playlists are suggested on the car's infotainment console and are shuffled based on the driver's command to play."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Setting up and working on Ford's SDL API's Android SDK.

Often, I find myself trying to view classes.berkeley.edu on my phone but it is extremely difficult to navigate the website UI on mobile. This inspired me to create a new and innovative way of navigating Berkeley's course catalogue that is more efficient on mobile devices. As I delved deeper into the chatbot development process, I realized that I didn't need to narrow my chatbot down to only a course finder. I wanted to make a chatbot that could perform a wide range of actions to best support the students here at Berkeley. An all purpose, know-it-all being that could do everything and answer all questions directed at it."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The chatbot currently has 4 main features. First, it has a help command that displays all of the other features that it contains. Second, it can provide course recommendations to students based on what graduation requirements they need to fulfill. Third, it can set reminders on students' Google Calendars for important events such as midterms and finals. Finally, it can direct students to lecture videos for courses they are taking."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used built the chatbot logic using Javascript and connected it to the Cisco Webex Teams messaging application through Cisco's webhooks. The app is deployed to the web via Microsoft Azure at https://oskibot.azurewebsites.net . The website serves as an entry point for the chat bot to connect to the Cisco Webex application. To test the application, we used ngrok to create a temporary URL/tunnel that would expose our local computer (where the chatbot is located during testing) to the Internet. Ngrok provides a much faster alternative to testing web apps because redeploying web apps after every modification is extremely inefficient.\n\nTo provide course recommendations, we used Google Firebase to store information about Berkeley courses. It sorts the courses into different categories to allow the user to quickly filter down to the most useful classes. We connected our chatbot to the database using Google's Firebase API to get read access to the course information.\n\nTo set reminders on students' Google Calendar, we utilized Transposit to connect the Google Calendar API to an event planning form to automate the event creation process. The form specifies that it should be used to keep track of test dates but it can technically be used to create any type of Google Calendar event.\n\nTo direct students to online lecture videos, we attempted to use Eluvio's API to optimize the video sharing process with blockchain technology, dubbed the Content Fabric. However, we were unable to upload our own videos to the Fabric so we created a demo website that uses a sample video from Eluvio."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of our biggest challenges was deciding what we wanted to create. When we first came into CalHacks, we didn't really have an idea of what we wanted to build. Our main goal was to attend as many workshops as we could to learn new skills. We tinkered around with many different technologies and failed a bunch until we finally decided to focus on one.\n\nOnce we finally decided on our chatbot idea, some challenges that we ran into was connecting the Webex application to our chatbot code. Since our bot is running on a local computer it is not accessible from Cisco Webex Cloud Platform. To work around this limitation, we had to create a tunnel between our development environment (local computer) to the Internet. Thankfully, ngrok takes care of this for us. ngrok is a tunneling technology that exposes our local port (which the chatbot is listening to) to the Internet through a randomly generated public URL.\n\nAlso, we wanted to utilize official Berkeley API's to retrieve course information, but the process requires going through many bureaucratic gates to receive authorization to use the API. We ended up manually entering some course information to the Google database to run our initial tests and demos. If we were to continue this project after CalHacks, we request access to the Berkeley API and connect it to our chatbot for a more complete database.\n\nWe also struggled with learning how to use the API's and how to connect different technologies together. However, after grinding through many online tutorials, we were able to figure out how to make them communicate correctly with each other."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of and What we learned","content":"We are most proud of all the skills that we learned here at CalHacks. We learned in-depth how to use Node.js, connect different technologies together using API's, and how to use Git to divide tasks between team members. We gained some intuition and understanding of network architecture through usage of ngrok and Microsoft Azure. We also gained a brief introduction to blockchain and this exposure has definitely piqued our interest in this emerging technology and its potential use cases."},{"heading":"What's next for OskiBot - UC Berkeley Course Recommendation Chatbot","content":"We would like to utilize the official UC Berkeley Classes API to have access to the most complete dataset. We would also like to use Machine Learning algorithms on the roster and signup data for each class to analyze classes more in-depth and create more filters/classifiers. For example, we can use the class registration data to figure out which classes have the highest dropout rate in the first few weeks to help users learn about which classes might be more difficult. We would also like to utilize machine learning to automate newer features and develop more capabilities into the chatbot to make it even more helpful for Berkeley students."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"azure cisco-webex eluvio firebase github javascript ngrok node.js react transposit"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com mbzhu1.github.io midterm-reminders-s8d1h.transposit.io github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:45:20.291187Z"}}
