Water You Using uses a network of custom-programmed water sensors that can be integrated directly into a building's water conduits to accurately measure the water usage of any of its faucets, showers, toilets, and other fixtures over time. Through our robust web application, users can learn more about which of their fixtures use the most water and when their peak water-usage times are - two very useful resources in determining how to save water."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We split the development process into three distinct sub-processes: backend, frontend, and hardware.\n\nThe backend was built in Python using Flask to handle all HTTP requests, and it serves as the backbone of the web app where all user-data is saved and all raw information is generated for use by the client and hardware components.\n\nThe frontend was built in ReactJS, and it processes the data provided by the backend into a format that users can easily understand.\n\nThe hardware component of our platform consists of a water sensor assembly that calculates the amount of water utilized during any given period of time from a specific device using a custom formula based on the flow time and the readings from our moisture sensor."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Among all four of us, the biggest issue we faced was communicating our ideas on how we would be transferring and representing our data between the client, server, and hardware. After (several) hours of refactoring, however, we were able to resolve these issues and successfully combine all of the components of our project.\n\nMitchell: \"The biggest challenge I faced when developing the backend was working around Python's syntax. Since this was my first time developing a full backend infrastructure in Python rather than using the Java-based backend stacks that I'm more familiar with, I had to spend a lot of time the first night just working around dynamic typing and Pythons odd syntactic restrictions. Once I worked around that, though, I was able to finish the backend pretty quickly, which allowed me to help out more with some of the issues the frontend team ran into.\"\n\nSabrina: \"My biggest challenge during this project was learning how to create a react app. I have never work with a front-end language before or had developed a web application. It was a rough first five hours, but I eventually learned and was able to format and create graphs, buttons, along other things. I really enjoyed the process and coming out of this experience, I feel much more comfortable with front-end programming.\""},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Above all else, we're extremely proud of the fact that we were actually able to build a finished and functional product that could potentially have a positive effect on the environment (and users' wallets) with so many moving parts in such a short amount of time. We're also proud of the fact that we all branched out and learned much more about various different development platforms and workflows outside of our comfort zones."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"All of us had to learn something new for this project to be successful. For the frontend, we had to spend an ungodly amount of time figuring out how to get our animations to work properly with React, but we all learned more about designing effective user interfaces in the process. The backend's development process was incredibly useful too since it taught us more about Python and how to properly configure servers with Flask. The most important things we learned from the hardware development process were how to interface with Bluetooth devices in low-energy mode and properly preventing leaks in our measurement system."},{"heading":"What's next for Water You Using?","content":"Water You Using would be a great platform for water companies to offer as an incentive for their customers. Since it provides meaningful information to customers that can make water usage monitoring much easier, it could easily be used to allow customers to save money by using less water, which would in-turn make water companies appear more favorably. Most importantly, though, it can help save resources, which would benefit all of us."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"3d-printing arduino arduinouno flask hc-08 node.js python raspberry-pi react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"gitlab.com"}]},{"project_title":"Finger Paint VR","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/finger-paint-vr","tagline":"Finger Paint is a VR painting game that allows for anybody to unleash their creativity and quickly put on an Oculus Quest to begin painting with their own hands without need for controllers or a PC.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/920/069/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake VII","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake-vii.devpost.com/","prize_name":"2nd Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"oculussampleframework","url":null},{"name":"ovr-toolkit","url":null},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"}],"external_links":[{"label":"drive.google.com","url":"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1xb80I5i1j7gAQ3ceb41vdmbppvH-ZkIE"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Other creativity focused VR applications such as Tilt Brush by Google along with the release of the Oculus hand tracking SDK inspired our team to create an application that allowed anyone to experiment with making VR Art by naturally using their hands without the barrier to entry of learning how to use a VR controller, which is what separates our VR painting solution from already present offerings."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Finger Paint VR currently allows the user to freely paint using the 6 different colors and 6 different brush sizes, using a tracked and fully mapped model of their physical hands in VR, supporting pinch and select gestures.

To discover how to leverage a large user base into a sustainable solution, we explored the three primary categories of freshwater withdrawal: thermoelectric power generation, public use, and agriculture/livestock raising.\n\nThermoelectric power generation is the largest use of fresh water every year. However, it is the category most distant from the user’s day-to-day habits: the water use in power generation is hardly affected by the length of showers. Rather, it depends on the efficiency of the cooling technology used in the plant.\n\nPublic use water withdrawal, on the contrary, is the closest to the user; it is the category most directly affected by user habits. However, it is the smallest of the three categories, and therefore it requires a dramatic improvement to match a small improvement in another category.\n\nThe final category is that of agriculture/livestock production. This category is nearly as large as thermoelectric power generation, and it is impacted by people’s habits: we choose whether water conservation is important in the foods we eat. Even more importantly, agriculture is the only of the three major categories with an increase in water use over the past 10 years.\n\nSo, we decided to create a platform to incentivize users to reduce water consumption by changing their food habits.\n\nThe most fundamental problem facing water conservation efforts is apathy. It is beneficial for the community to reduce water use, but there is little incentive for any one person to reduce their consumption.\n\nWe want to encourage an action, but people have little incentive to do it for themselves. However, we observe that when that action is done in public, witnessed by the community that benefits from the action, the action becomes more common. By making it social, we incentivize the action.\n\nThis phenomenon, known as The Network Effect, has been utilized successfully by a number of platforms. One of the most notable is Strava, a social platform for runners/bikers to share their workouts. We seek to use this effect for the benefit of water conservation."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Rippl is a social platform. Users sign up for a profile on rippl, joining a community of their peers to track their water consumption habits through the food they eat. As a social platform, users have a set of followers/friends, and they are able to see the water consciousness of those friends.\n\nEach individual user has two ways to track their water consumption. They can log their food using our built-in QR reader, or they can integrate with myFitnessPal to import existing food habits. We use datasets sourced from a variety of sources to turn that food consumption data into how much water it took to produce that food.\n\nTo incentivize community building, we have a set of community leaderboards and challenges celebrating those who successfully reduce water consumption."},{"heading":"How We built it","content":"We created an iOS app using Swift and XCode. Before developing the implementation, we used Sketch and the Adobe CC for design and prototyping.\n\nOur backend is a Python Flask REST API, utilizing Pandas for data parsing/analytics, and it is deployed on Heroku.
