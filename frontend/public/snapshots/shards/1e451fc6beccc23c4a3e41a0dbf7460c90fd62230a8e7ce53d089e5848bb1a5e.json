The app presents users with a dotted image of a spiral, which they must trace using either their finger or a stylus on a touch screen. Their trace is analyzed by a machine learning algorithm, which reports back to the user whether they are potentially at risk of Parkinson's or not based on their tracing."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"First, we used static spiral test data from Istanbul University to recreate spirals of individuals with and without Parkinson's using matplotlib (python). We cleaned up the data by centering these spirals and made them have the same resolution and dimensions. Then, we built a convolutional neural network to train our TensorFlow model in Google Cloud Platform. Time was spent optimizing the parameters (pool size, num convolutions, num neurons) to maximize accuracy."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"It was difficult to manipulate all of the spiral data into a consistent format which would be usable by the program. In addition, setting up the Google Cloud Platform, having it support all of the packages we were using, and using it to train the model was fairly difficult and required a lot of research. Also, we had to play very many games against the network we were training in order to make it actually learn and not resort to a trivial local solution of guessing that the person always does or does not have Parkinson's, for example."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our model holds 96% accuracy in distinguishing between Parkinson's and non-Parkinson's results. Each of our team members would consistently score at only about 60% accuracy, far below the computer's discernment abilities. We also successfully developed an iOS application that instructs and allows users to take the static spiral test themselves."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to develop streamlined and functional Swift applications, how to set up and train machine learning models on Google Cloud Platform, how to effectively use Pandas to clean and mine relevant data, and how to use Firebase as a database to store the test results of our application."},{"heading":"What's next for Spiro","content":"First, we plan to automatically train the model on the new data stored in the Firebase database after an arbitrary timeframe. Then, we plan to expand support to Android as a mobile platform. Finally, we plan to increase the depth of the model used and epochs trained in order to increase accuracy.\n\nP.S. We also built an extra little mini-game which puts you against our algorithm.

When the application is executed, the client takes an image of a lesion on their skin using their smartphone, providing data about their age, gender, and the region of the body where the picture is taken. This is then sent to a server where it is compared with a ML model to predict the type of lesion on the skin, and to determine if it is cancerous. Afterwards, the client is sent back data about the potential characteristics of their disease. The ML model is trained using a data set of 10,000 images of skin lesions acquired from kaggle.com: https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000 Limitations of the model include the size of the data set, and the number of images taken to evaluate a skin lesion."},{"heading":"Skin Cancer Types and Info, the types that we can detect","content":"Actinic keratoses and intraepithelial carcinoma / Bowen's disease (akiec): Cancerous, treatable Bowen's disease, also known as squamous cell carcinoma in situ is a neoplastic skin disease.

Seborrheic keratoses are normally painless and require no treatment. You may decide to have them removed if they become irritated by clothing or for cosmetic reasons. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-keratosis/symptoms-causes/syc-20353878\n\ndermatofibroma (df): Cancerous, treatable, grows slowly Dermatofibroma is a very rare type of skin cancer that begins in connective tissue cells in the middle layer of your skin (dermis). It grows slowly and rarely spreads beyond the skin. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/dermatofibrosarcoma-protuberans/cdc-20352949\n\nmelanoma (mel): Cancerous, treatable if detected early Melanoma is the most serious type of skin cancer. Knowing the warning signs of skin cancer can help ensure that cancerous changes are detected and treated before the cancer has spread. Melanoma can be treated successfully if it is detected early. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884\n\nmelanocytic nevi (nv): Non-cancerous A usually noncancerous disorder of pigment-producing skin cells commonly called birth marks or moles. They can exist at birth or appear later. Rarely, melanocytic nevi can become cancerous. Most cases don't require treatment, but some cases require removal of the mole. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/moles/symptoms-causes/syc-20375200\n\nvascular lesions (angiomas, angiokeratomas, pyogenic granulomas and hemorrhage, vasc): Non-cancerous Pyogenic granulomas are skin growths that are small, round, and usually bloody red in color.
