we made it","content":"The two of us have (combined) most of a decade of security education experience. This project was born of a desire to make this kind of training more accessible for people who don't have the time to spin up and configure a linux machine and then acquire vulnerable binaries just to learn basic reverse engineering. This project lets any user spin up a full shell with a set of powerful reversing tools installed in seconds and start hacking immediately."},{"heading":"Who can benefit","content":"Anyone who wants to learn more about how computers work (and cease to work) can benefit from this. We can see a monetization of this being really disruptive in the training industry, or a friendlier version being a huge player in education, but in general, this kind of lowering of the barriers to education can only be a good thing."},{"heading":"What we're proud of","content":"Over the weekend, we brought setup time for education of this time down from (a quite conservative) 2-3 hours to 2-3 minutes at most. Not only that, but we vastly simplified the actual setup process, so you don't need to understand package managers and compilers or have years of sysadmin experience to play with objdump and gdb. The project itself combined everything from web programming to security to low-level systems to virtualization and sysadmin skills in one coherent (albeit unconventional) stack. We took a really inaccessible field and made it so anyone with our URL can start learning immediately with some technically awesome code."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bash c css html

is an app for travelers and explorers who want to share their knowledge and leverage their social networks to find travel advice, but don't want the distraction of having to pull out a mobile device to mark where they've been. The ease of contributing to MetropoliPin's crowdsourced data means that it will be easier than ever before to plan a day out in town or a vacation in a foreign city based on the advice of people you know and trust."},{"heading":"The Headset & Dropping Pins","content":"MetripoliPin is integrated with the NeuroSky MindWave Mobile EEG reader headset, which uses dry, non-intrusive connection points to read your brain wave data and transmit it to our back-end system. Thus instead of needing to pull out a phone to mark interesting places you encounter throughout the day, you simply need to blink deliberately and MetropoliPin will drop a pin at your current location. Then later you can go back through the pins you have dropped and leave a brief rating so you can remember how positive or negative the experience was and share this information with friends."},{"heading":"Trip Planning","content":"When you want to go on vacation or just explore your own backyard, you can use your friends' pins to guide your way. Search for a city, then a listing of where your friends have been will appear, along with their ratings. You can select a number of these pins for your trips, supplemented by suggestions from Yelp. If you set up a schedule of when you want to visit each pin, Twilio will send a reminder text every time that you need to move on to the next pin."},{"heading":"Technologies","content":"Our system has two applications, a Ruby on Rails mobile web app hosted on Heroku and a native Android app. The core of the user interface is located in the Ruby on Rails app, along with all of our data modeling, while the Android app is used for connecting the NeuroSky headset to the internet. We use the Google maps API for graphically representing the pins, the Yelp API for finding local places, and the Twilio API for sending reminder texts."},{"heading":"Future Improvements","content":"We were supposed to be on the Hackathon TV program at HackDFW, but the 1 inch of snow in Dallas was too much for our airline, and after delaying us for over 5 hours in the airport, they canceled our flight. So, we drove to HackIllinois from the Detroit airport (DTW) early Saturday morning, arriving to the event 12 hours late. Because we had 24 hours instead of 36, we ended up with a lot of ideas for future improvements that we simply did not have time to complete this time around. These include:\n\nIntegration with Pebble so the user can confirm that they intended to drop a pin and can immediately rate the place instead of waiting until they get back on the mobile web app Recording more elaborate information about your friends' experiences at these locations, including a short audio clip where they describe the place or a graphical representation of the brain waves your friends experienced at the place Adding a \"sub pin\" and \"super pin\" concept. Sub pins could be as fine grained as the location of a specific statue within a park, while super pins would be locations like entire parks.

more than $3 billion in crop losses for Illinois alone, and $17 billion in the US. Any preventative measures, no matter how small, could save farmers a significant crop supply. Since people and places are spread out in rural areas, AgroAlerts can allow people to prepare hours in advance for situations that could ruin their crops, like hailstorms or flooding."},{"heading":"How does it help?","content":"Many web and mobile apps rely on the user owning a smart phone with a touch screen, but we recognize that such a device is not always convenient for outdoor work. A phone call demands more immediate attention than a text message or a notification, and it can be sent to any device with working phone service.\n\nUpon receiving a phone call, the user is told what the emergency is, and asks them to dial a number to contact different people (ie: \"Press '1' to call Maintenance\"). If we were to extend this as a real service, the farmers could specify which types of emergencies they wish to receive updates for, and which people they would like to contact for the varying situations. This provides a hassle-free way to quickly talk to the right people and resolve issues immediately, which can greatly improve efficiency and minimize crop loss on an operation as large as a farm."},{"heading":"Implementation Details","content":"We used the John Deere API to get real data on John Deere tractors (geolocation, engine use, maintenance alerts) as well as coordinates of fields and their boundaries, and the OpenWeatherMap API to get real-time weather data for these farms. Then, we spawn multiple threads which each constantly update data and check for emergency conditions. If an emergency is detected, a phone call is made with the Interactive Intelligence Hackathon API and the software continues to check for other situations."},{"heading":"Built
