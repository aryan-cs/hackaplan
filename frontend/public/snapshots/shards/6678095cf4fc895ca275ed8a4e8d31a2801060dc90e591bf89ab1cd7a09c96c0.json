After some light Google searching, we found out that it may be possible to leverage this idea in locations outside of his parents' basement."},{"heading":"Initial Research 🔎","content":"What we found out is that there are places where the heat generated by computers would not be considered a feature, but a useless byproduct. For example, cooling can be up to 40% of a data center’s total energy usage. Large bitcoin farms are experiencing the same issues, employing fans and air conditioners to move heat away from their devices."},{"heading":"Problem 💭","content":"Is there a way to reduce cooling loads by redistributing this heat to people who need to make these technologies more sustainable?"},{"heading":"What is the Box with Rounded Corners? 📦","content":"The Box with Rounded Corners ( The Box in short) is a platform where cryptocurrency miners could be used to provide free heating for small businesses. It consists of a custom-designed cryptocurrency mining rig, a smart thermostat system, and a data visualization platform powered by AI and ML to allow business owners to heat up their spaces more efficiently and effectively.\n\nThe Box is a 3d printed housing that stores computing hardware required to mine crypto. William custom-designed an ASIC chip that accelerates sha256 hashing. This design was made using Google’s open-source SkyWater PDK and we hope to realize it into silicon if possible. In the future, this computing box will work in conjunction with energy storage hardware.\n\nTherma , another part of our product, is a smart thermostat. Therma communicates with the box to control heating. By setting Therma higher, The Box will provide computing power or mine crypto. It uses Mage to predict ML models for determining which heating source is most efficient depending on external factors like predicted crypto price, past weather trends, and carbon footprint of the electricity source.\n\nChristy created a dashboard that helps the user visualize what happens within their Boxes and how it impacts the user. The main page shows stats for daily usage, an overview of monthly usage, crypto mined, as well as a comparison between using crypto mining (renewable energy resources) vs fossil fuels to heat up their space. There are also many other tabs that allow the user to control which of their boxes should be actively mining, more robust visualizations of environmental impact using VMWare’s Wavefront , regulation of temperature through Mage’s ML model predictions , and more of the costs and earnings breakdown. There is also a donation option that encourages users to donate to offset their carbon footprint.\n\nWe initially started our project by doing visualizations with graphs and diagrams from MUI. However, we pivoted to using VMWare’s Wavefront after discovering how comprehensive and informative the graphs were for our users. We wanted to really showcase the sustainability factor of the Box with Rounded Corners product to encourage greener mining so it was useful for us to be able to highlight the data around environmental impact. While developing our product, we thought it would be amazing to have a way to share the dashboard without logging in.\n\nOur product uses Mage to train all our machine learning models to come up with predictions for when is the most efficient and effective time to mine crypto/increase room temperature, as well as predicting when there would be an excess of cleaner/renewable energy (ie. certain hours of the day have more energy generated from windmills) to mine more crypto. We were extremely amazed at how easy it was to train a model on the platform because one of us had no machine learning experience before. However, we did wish it could be more customized and allow for fine adjustment of parameters."},{"heading":"Advantages for Small Businesses 👍","content":"By using the Box with Rounded Corners , small businesses can be reimbursed for their energy usage, while lowering their heating bills. 43% of a small businesses’ energy usage is actually dedicated to space heating."},{"heading":"Theoretical Savings 💾","content":"In 2019, bitcoin mining consumed 111.7 terawatt-hours of power, or roughly equivalent to the power consumption of the Netherlands. If we were to assume a conservative savings estimate of 20% due to the reduction of cooling loads, the Box with Rounded Corners could theoretically provide a savings of 11.17 terawatt-hours per year if 50% of all bitcoin miners were to switch to our platform. The energy saved constitutes a reduction of 4.75 million tons of CO2 emissions per year and is enough to power 434,724 households for a year.\n\nHow Bitcoin's vast energy use could burst its bubble - BBC News\n\nhttps://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=74&t=11"},{"heading":"How We Built It 🔨","content":"The smart thermostat communicates with the box via an esp32 over wifi. The Box hosts a local copy of the backend server that talks with the Mage Api for our ML needs. The box also hosts the dashboard which provides visualization in conjunction with VMWare . We also designed 3d models of our Box and Therma products using SolidWorks and printed them out using a 3d printer."},{"heading":"About the Hardware 🔌","content":"We built several hardware projects to actualize our project. The smart thermostat “Therma” was created using an esp32 for the brains, which connects over wifi to the box. The esp32 controls relays to interface with existing heating networks while also providing an interactive display to display the status of the home. It also sends temperature data to the box for further processing. Unfortunately, due to shipping delays we were not able to add occupancy sensors to the thermostat which would give our ML models more data to create a better prediction. On a side note, the green cover plate is 3d printed in glow in the dark filament so changing the temperature in the dark of night will be a problem of the past.\n\nWe also designed and tested an ASIC meant to accelerate sha256 hashing. This design was heavily inspired by Joachim Strömbergson’s design and was truly an interesting project. This chip is meant to be included in the box to increase the efficiency and speed of crypto mining. This is similar to how purpose-built crypto miners are made and we would love to learn more."},{"heading":"Challenges We Ran Into 🔥","content":"Our biggest challenge was trying to build Web 3.0 using Web 2.0 technologies. Some of the challenges we faced were hardware-related. Our 3d printer experienced clogging issues, bed adhesion problems, and the filament was too old so we had to reprint our parts four times in total. Additionally, we did not have any experience working with sha256 hashing so there was a steep learning curve to understand how to design the ASIC chip. On the software end, there was some difficulty cleaning up datasets so the trained models had realistic predictions."},{"heading":"Accomplishments We're Proud Of 🌟","content":"We are extremely proud of what we were able to accomplish during this hackathon. We have been each other’s hackathon buddies for a while now but we’ve never been able to build and develop so much within a weekend before. We are particularly proud of being able to understand each others’ strengths and weaknesses so we could help each other out and teach one another new things during the project. William learned a lot about sha256 hashing while Christy finally tried machine learning for the first time!"},{"heading":"What's Next ▶️","content":"Our final goal is to realize a network of decentralized edge servers capable of running applications on demand. This would involve creating a network of boxes that can communicate and distribute applications like IPFS but for applications. The final form of our network would be able to provide decentralized edge computing to any application that would want to be both decentralized and sustainable.\n\nWe would also love to build out the energy storage hardware. This would involve building and testing a battery pack that will safely charge and discharge to supplement the grid. It would also involve building the ML algorithms needed to accurately predict when to charge and discharge the batteries so it is not only sustainable but also provides redundancy to the grid.\n\nAditionally, we would love to see if our ASIC chip actually works. To achieve this we would send our design to a foundry like TSMC (we need a formal verification of the chip prior to this). With the limited time of a hackathon, only a very basic test suite was performed on the chip.\n\nWith the creation of our platform, this would create a robust, decentralized, and sustainable computing network available everywhere for everyone to use."},{"heading":"Ethics 🌈","content":"Cryptocurrency has been at the forefront of criticism through its ethical and environmental impact. A single bitcoin transaction alone burns approximately 2,292.5 kilowatt-hours of energy - enough to power a house for 78 days. The environmental cost of cryptocurrency is what steers potential Web 3.0 users away, driving an ever-expanding digital divide. Because of these reasons, we believe that the excess waste created from cryptocurrency mining is ethically unsustainable for the future. Although efforts have been made using technologies such as renewable energy, this does not solve the issue of the core byproducts of cryptocurrencies, such as e-waste and waste heat.\n\nOur team has proposed to relocate this waste, specifically the thermal energy created by cryptocurrency miners, to heat small businesses at a reimbursed cost. Box with Rounded Corners strives to empower small businesses while offsetting the environmental impact of crypto mining through our dedicated platform. We plan on creating opportunities for users to invest these earnings into environmental organizations to empower positive impact within their own communities. While we acknowledge and identify that by providing a more sustainable solution to mining, we are also in turn promoting the use of cryptocurrency. Intermediate environmental costs such as the amount of energy needed to produce, buy and add products to the blockchain are high and our solution does not directly tackle this preliminary step. By adding a ‘safety net’ solution with our heat relocation, we are still enabling users to mine more cryptocurrencies and continue to contribute to energy waste.\n\nWhile crypto mining is inevitable, it’s important to acknowledge additional ethical implications other than just the environmental cost connected to the purpose of our organization.\n\nTargeting small business owners as our user base can be intimidating especially in the midst of the digital gap and the new concept of cryptocurrency. We recognize that there may be many business owners who may not trust the viability of our product and assume ulterior motives. Our team attempts to alleviate user experience by supplying small business owners with all the tools and transparency needed to boost confidence in utilizing our products. With our dashboard and familiar functionalities, users of all skill levels have been considered when implementing the UI by creating comprehensive labels and transparent data visualization while following WCAG3 standards.\n\nIt is the intention of Box with Rounded Corners to use smart contracts and blockchain technologies to ensure that no parties can alter any details within the agreement. While this will cause some environmental impacts due to the energy required to add to the blockchain, we will strive to minimize this impact while maintaining trust between our company and our users.\n\nIn the future, we hope to tackle our ethical concerns by conducting user research. It’s important for us to pinpoint the exact needs, behaviors, and pain points of our users in order to find the best solution - instead of just prescribing one."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android arduino cadence expressif figma github javascript maje materialui node.js python quartusprime react solidworks vmware web3.0"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"treehacks2022-frontend-phi.vercel.app github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Static Contact is All You Need: Nimble Hands for VR Avatars","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/static-contact-is-all-you-need-dexterous-manipulation-in-vr","tagline":"Using machine learning to synthesize dexterous VR animations for better simulation","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/842/848/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2022","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2022.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Most Technically Complex"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"bullet","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Humans use their hands so much that we often take for granted how easy it is to use them in a nimble way.

The primary inspiration for this particular solution came from a recent experience of one of our team members Aditya Bora. Aditya’s mother works as a child psychiatrist in one of the largest children's hospitals in Atlanta, GA. On a recent visit to the hospital, Aditya was introduced to a girl who was paralyzed from the neck down due to a tragic motor vehicle accident. While implementing a brain computer interface to track her eyes seemed like an obvious solution, Aditya learned that technology had yet to be commercially available for those with disabilities such as quadriplegia. After sharing this story with the rest of the team and learning that others had also encountered a lack of assistive technology for those with compromised mobility, we decided that we wanted to create a novel BCI solution. Imagine the world of possibilities that could be opened for them if this technology would allow interaction with a person’s surroundings by capturing inputs via neural activity. Brainstorm hopes to lead the charge for this innovative technology."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We built a wearable electrode headset that gets neural data from the brain, and decodes it into 4 discrete signals. These signals represent the voltage corresponding to neuron activity in the electrode’s surrounding area. In real-time, the computer processes the electrical activity data through a decision tree model to predict the desired action of the user. This output can then be used for a number of different applications which we developed. These include\n\nRC Wheelchair Demo: This system was designed to simulate that control of a motorized wheelchair would be possible via a BCI. In order to control the RC car via the BCI inputs, microcontroller GPIO pins were connected to the remote control’s input pins allowing for the control of the RC system via the parsed out of the BCI rather than the manual control. The microcontroller reads in the BCI input via the serial monitor on the computer and activates the GPIO pins which correspond to control of the RC car Fan Demo: This was a simple circuit which leverages a DC motor to simulate if a user was controlling a fan or another device which can be controlled via a binary input (i.e. on/off switch)."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One of our biggest challenges was in decoding intent from the frontal lobe. We struggled with defining the optimal placement of electrodes in our headset, and then in actually translating the electroencephalography data into discrete commands. We spent a lot of time reading relevant literature in neurotechnology, working on balancing signal-to-noise ratios, and doing signal processing and transform methods to better model and understand our data."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We’re proud of developing a product that gives quadriplegics the ability to move solely based on their thoughts, while also creating a companion platform that enables a smart home environment for quadriplegics.

Furthermore, 5 Billion people live in developing countries where government and financial institutions are prone to corruption. Initially, we wanted to create a framework for identity on the blockchain that can be used to increase accessibility to financial services and offer consumers a ‘fair deal’, regardless of their personal information. Users are given a ‘clean record’ and are judged solely on their web3 activities, with decentralized banks rewarding loyalty and punishing malicious actions.\n\nHowever, we decided to take this idea one step further and develop a protocol that solves the problem of accessibility and accountability within web3. Protocols can log ownerships of assets, engagements within communities, loans from banks, and many more web3 interactions onto the user’s iD . This allows for cross-platform compatibility, the development of credit scores, protection against bots, and a new way to anonymously login, all on top of the same framework, opening up new possibilities for what is possible on web3."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"3iD authenticates users with the help of identification authorities to ensure a one-to-one mapping between people and iDs. This ensures users are incentivized to maintain a ‘clean record’ on their iD and are kept accountable for their web3 activities. Once a 3iD NFT has been created, the owner of the iD can grant permission for protocols it interacts with to open a page and log the user’s relevant actions. Once an event has been logged on the Filecoin decentralized database, the record cannot be removed. 3iD follows an extensive list of precautions to ensure a NFT can never be paired with its owner: a user enrolls with a ‘temporary’ and a ‘private’ Ethereum wallet and uses a zero-knowledge protocol to securely transfer ownership to its private address. Identification authorities are also never given the address of either of the user’s wallets and sensitive files are deleted immediately after users have been verified. More information can be found on our documentation."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started with the problem of fixing the loaning system in the world. Deserving people will not be able to take a loan from a traditional bank due to a lack of access, criminal record, or due to being part of an underrepresented community. Additionally, Defi Apps cannot afford to give anything better than fully collateralized loans due to the risk of bots and inherent anonymity of their clients. Therefore we set out to build a protocol which would maintain the anonymity and privacy of users whilst ensuring the accountability and trust that occurs in traditional banking. We spent a long time developing the protocol and ensuring we have the necessary security and decentralization in our system. We were shocked to find that there is no other current decentralized protocol that offers a similar system to ours: combining anonymous identity verification with bookkeeping on the blockchain.\n\nOnce the protocol was figured out, we then created technical documentation explaining each step of the protocol and the security measures we take. We then decided to split our task into four core roles: developing the backend web to solidity interaction, writing the Ethereum smart contracts for the identity authentication protocol, interaction with the decentralized Filecoin database, and frontend web development and graphics. Whilst each member focused on their key roles, we ensured that the team was constantly communicating and helping each other. We wrote our smart contracts for the identification protocol and database management in solidity and deployed them on the Kovan testnet. The interaction with the Filecoin database was done using an HTTP API for Web3 Storage and Chainlink oracles to communicate data out of the blockchain. For the backend web development we used react (JavaScript), flask (Python) and the web3 and metamask APIs to integrate with the on-chain smart contracts."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The first challenge we faced was to learn Solidity programming in order to develop the smart contracts. We had to get acquainted with the blockchain development ecosystem and learn about the industry standards for privacy and data security within the blockchain. The second big challenge we faced was the integration of on-chain smart contracts with the off-chain website backend. We had to implement a multitude of APIs to integrate with the functionality of making smart contract calls from the website itself, furthermore, we had to incorporate oracles to communicate data outside the blockchain whilst still maintaining a decentralized data flow and control. Upon integration of the smart contracts with the website, we uncovered a huge array of new bugs that took many hours and late night snacks to debug."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We were able to develop a legitimate solution to a problem that is fundamental to our society: how to have accountability and trust whilst retaining privacy and anonymity? We are also really proud that we were able to develop the entire working system and integrate both on-chain and off-chain systems that are inter compatible. We are also proud of our beautiful and slick frontend website and logo."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"In terms of skills, we learned how to program smart contracts in Solidity and strongly improved our knowledge of JavaScript. We also learned about the blockchain ecosystem and the privacy and identity space. We developed a much stronger understanding of cryptography: Diffie Helman, Shamir Secret Sharing, ZK-proofs, ZK-rollups, PLONKS, Tor and IP masking.

This turned to be the biggest hurdle in our project that we needed to figure out. Dealing with the API endpoints and Solidarity integration was one of the problems we had to leave for future developments. One solution to a challenge we solved was dealing with difficulty of the backend development and setting up API endpoints. Without a persistent data storage in the backend, we attempted to implement basic storage using localStorage in the browser to facilitate a user experience. This allowed us to implement a majority of our features as a temporary fix for our demonstration. Some other challenges we faced included figuring certain syntactical elements to the new technologies we dealt (such as using Hooks and States in React.js). It was a great learning opportunity for our group as immersing ourselves in the project allowed us to become more familiar with each technology!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"One notable accomplishment is that every member of our group interface with new technology that we had little to no experience with!

We aim to revolutionise accessibility and fun in music creation .\n\nFrom real-world users:\n\n1. Learning music isn’t fun, getting good takes >10,000 hours: Our parents forced 2 members of our team to learn a musical instrument as kids. We hated it. It simply wasn’t fun. It took us a long time to reach a level high enough to compose music. We wanted to make music composition more accessible and fun for absolute beginners and people who wouldn’t normally associate music/art with themselves .\n\n2. Most people can drive, few can play an instrument : The majority of adults are able to drive a vehicle, while only those that went through childhood toil can play an instrument – we saw some potential there. Can we use what people already know? To make music? To learn about music? To create? Music/playing an instrument is seen as an elitist hobby, many adults stay away from it – we want to break that assumption.\n\n3. Dyslexic, Deaf, Blind, Paraplegia – Music Accessibility: How can the deaf hear music? How can the Dyslexic and Blind read sheet music? How can the physically paralysed (Paraplegia) play an instrument? We wanted to design a new form of music information, a new medium of sense to convey what these groups of people lack. Inspiration from a Taste Visualization scene from The movie “Ratatouille”"},{"heading":"Mission Statement:","content":"Carscendo’s is to provide a passive music compositional platform through the innovative medium of a multiplayer VR racing experience.\n\nWhat exactly does that entail?\n\nThrough a combination of environmental and inter-vehicular interactions, the way a player races is reflected through changes in 3 core musical elements: emphasis, tone, and rhythm. By playing Carscendo, users who may consider themselves not musically inclined and discouraged from using conventional composition systems are able to passively develop an intuition for the core principles of music composition while enjoying a multiplayer racing experience.\n\nWhy a racing game?\n\nThe car racing aspects not only provide an interface that people of most ages and backgrounds are familiar with as a concept (driving a car), but allow non-musicians to derive enjoyment from practice even if their musical skills are poor. By giving players this alternative outlet for enjoyment, they are encouraged to play for long enough time to develop musical intuition without even realizing it."},{"heading":"Considerations","content":"1. Crescendo’s capabilities grow with the player’s experience level as they play the game\n\nAs players improve their skills in the game, they gain greater agency over the music their ‘drive’ produces, meaning that new and experienced players alike have something foundational to enjoy together.\n\n2. Carsendo should serve as a fun experience for anyone to play and learn from- regardless of physical ability\n\nWhile the mainstream VR gaming industry is still in its early stages, we think it crucial to set the standards for inclusivity higher than they have been for conventional games.\n\nMany games assume a high level of physical and cognitive ability, thus players who may have impairments in either of those two areas either have to exert considerably more effort than a fully abled player, not be able to enjoy many facets of the experience, or not be able to play the game at all.\n\nIn the design of Carscendo, we implemented the gameplay mechanics in as inclusive a way as possible. Some of these specific considerations include:\n\nvisual elements paired with any audio feedback for hard of hearing or deaf players controls that require low levels of digit dexterity for players with tremors or joint issues a UI system based on environment interactions rather than text for those who struggle reading, and so it can be easily understood regardless of language."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"How we improve accessibility and empower creativity & fun:\n\n1. More Accessible and Fun medium of Music Composition: built-into racing game mechanics:\n\nCar selection chooses a background track. Driving at different speeds changes the rhythm and volume of the background track. Collecting power-ups (like mario-kart) on the road, adds melodies and tunes . Looping feature allows remixing and deeper composing. Record feature allows exporting of creation . Multiplayer allows collaboration between experienced/inexperienced friends.\n\nDriving is the mechanism, the proof of concept we are demonstrating – that music can be created in more modern ways with current technology than the old strings and drums. In the future, we want to explore other mediums/methods/mechanisms to make more people creators.\n\n2. Dyslexic, Deaf, Blind, Paraplegia – Music Accessibility:\n\nDeaf : we represent music through stunning audio visualisations Dyslexic : we represent music notes through patterns and shapes (easier to read) Blind : we use haptic feedback and vibrations to aid sensory Physically paralysed : we use oculus quest 2 eye tracking to allow interactions of driving"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"VR : Oculus Quest, Unity3D, C# 3D Modelling & Animation: Autodesk Maya, Adobe Photoshop, Unity3D, Blender UX & UI: Figma, Unity2D, Unity3D Graphic Design : Adobe Photoshop, Procreate, Adobe Illustrator Audio Visualisation: Frequency analysis, Fast Fourier Transform, Koch Fractals, Audio Spectrum Analysis Android version : CAD for 3D printable steering wheel with android phone housing"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Challenges:\n\nVR Interaction physics are really difficult to write from the ground up.

Later we would support others platforms such as Zoom, Webex, Skype, and others.\n\nWhen the user joins the Google Meet meeting, our Extension automatically detects it and collects statistics regarding the participation of each team member. A percentage is shown next to their name to indicate their contribution and also a ranking is shown that indicates how often you spoke compared to others. When the meeting ends, all of this data is sent to the web app dashboard using Google Cloud and Firebase database. On the web app, the users can see their participation in the current meeting and progress from the past meetings with different metrics. Plants are how we gamify participation. Your personal plant grows, the more you contribute in meetings. Meetings are organized through sprints and contribution throughout the sprint will be reflected in the growth of the plant.\n\nDashboard : You can see your personal participation statistics. It show your plant, monthly interaction level graph, percent interaction with other team members (how often and which teammates you piggy back on when responding). Lastly, it also has Overall Statistics such as percent increase in interactions compared to last week, meeting participation streak, average engagement time, and total time spoken. You can see your growth in participation reflected in the plant growth. Vocal provides lots of priceless data for the management, HR, and for the team overall to improve productivity and inclusivity.\n\nTeam : Many times our teammates are stressed or go through other feelings but simply bottle it up. In the Team page, we provide Team Sentiment Graph and Team Sentiments. The graphs shows how everyone in the team has been feeling for the current sprint. Team members would check in anonymously at the end of the every week on how they’re feeling (Stressed, Anxious, Neutral, Calm, Joyful) and the whole team can see it. If someone’s feeling low, other teammates can reach out anonymously in the chat and offer them support and they both can choose to reveal their identity if they want. Feeling that your team cares about you and your mental health can foster an inclusive community.\n\nSprints Garden : This includes all of the previous sprints that you completed. It also shows the whole team’s garden so you can compare across teammates on how much you have been contributing relatively.\n\nProfile : This is your personal profile where you will see your personal details, the plants you have grown in the past over all the sprints you have worked on - your forest, your anonymous conversations with your team members. Your garden is here to motivate you and help you grow more plants and ultimately contribute more to meetings.\n\nEthics/Privacy: We found very interesting ways to collect speaking data without being intrusive. When the user is talking only the mic pulses are recorded and analyzed as a person spoken. No voice data or transcription is done to ensure that everyone can feel safe while using the extension.\n\nSustainability/Social Good : Companies that use Vocal can partner to plant the trees grown during sprints in real life by partnering with organizations that plant real trees under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiative."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The System is made up of three independent modules.

I'm William. I care about doing efficient Computer Vision and I think that this project highlights some great potential ideas for ensuring we can stay efficient."},{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"I've recently been very interested in making ML (and specifically Computer Vision) more efficient. There exist many recent analyses of making ML more efficient. These papers showcase a variety of different approaches to improve model efficiency and reduce global impact. If you're not sold on why model efficiency matters, I encourage you to skim over some of those papers.\n\nSome key takeaways are as follows:\n\nA majority of energy is spent serving models than training (90%-10%) (Patterson et al.) There are three major focuses we can use to improve model implementation efficiency More Efficient Architectures --Model inference cost (in FLOPs), as well as model size (number of parameters), is growing exponentially. It is necessary to design and utilize algorithms that learn and infer more efficiently. The authors highlight two promising approaches, Mixture of Expert models and approaches which perform more efficient attention (BigBird, LinFormer, Nystromformer). More Efficient Hardware --The only reason we are able to train these larger models is because of more complex hardware. Specialized hardware, such as TPUs or Cerebras' WSE shows promising results in performance per watt. Authors find that specialized hardware can improve efficiency 2-5x. More Efficient Energy (Datacenter/Energy Generation) --The location that these models are run on also has a significant impact on the efficiency of inference time. By computing locally, as well as in a place where we can efficiently generate energy, we can reduce the impact of our models.\n\nThese goals, however, conflict with many current approaches in Machine Learning implementation.\n\nIn the NLP space, we are quickly moving towards models that are being trained for longer on larger, multi-lingual datasets. Recent SOTA works (Megatron-LM) are nearly 10 Trillion parameters. Training GPT-3 (once!) takes the CO2 equivalent of three round trip flights from SF-NY (1,287 MWh).\n\nIn Computer Vision, a push towards using attention-based architectures as well as focusing on higher-resolution or videos (rather than images) has led to a sharp increase in the cost to train and perform inference in a model.\n\nWe propose a new workflow to assist with the implementation of efficient Computer Vision.\n\nRather than training a single model from scratch, we separate the encoding and fine-tuning aspects of a task.\n\nSpecifically, we train a single, large, self-supervised model on an unlabelled, high-resolution dataset. After building a strong encoding, we can fine-tune small, efficient prediction heads on those encodings to solve a specific task. We utilize Scale.ai's platform to automate labeling."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We use UIUC's Almacam as a proof of concept for this topic. We want to show that you can take some arbitrary data source and build out an extremely efficient, data-drift resistant, (mostly) task-agnostic inference pipeline.\n\nOur contribution has x major components:\n\nAutomatic data collection pipeline -- We design a small server that automatically collects data from the UIUC AlmaCam and uploads it to the Scale.ai server as well as uploading to some data centers. Self Supervision for Image Encoding -- Instead of training a model end-to-end on local/inefficient hardware, we train in a (theoretical) data center. This allows us to still leverage extremely large models on extremely large data while maintaining long-term stability and efficiency. -- We train a self-supervised ViT/Nystromformer hybrid model on high resolution* images. We require the use of efficient (Nystromformer) attention and we have large (48x48) image patches to accommodate for the high resolution images. Fine Tuned Heads -- We showcase that this approach maintains accuracy by fine-tuning very small prediction heads on the image encoding alone (NONE of the original images is passed to the heads). -- We show that these prediction heads can be quickly and easily trained on a new task. This means we do not have to retrain the larger encoding model when we want to apply it to a new task!\n\n*We train on 576x960, normally people train on 224x224 so this is ~11x larger. We can train on the raw (1920x1080, almost 4x larger) resolution without adverse effects, but not over a weekend!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Everything is written in Python. I use PyTorch for ML things and Flask for server things.\n\nAutomatic data collection pipeline:\n\nThis was relatively straightforward. We have Flask automatically execute some bash scripts to first grab the .m3u8 playlist URL from YouTube. Then, we have ffmpeg scrape frames from that m3u8 file into a separate directory. After a certain number of images are downloaded, we hit the Scale.ai API to upload these images and associated metadata (time of day) to their database.\n\nOriginally, I had configured this server to automatically create a batch (a new set of images to be labeled) but I found it easier to manually do it (since creating batches can be expensive and I only got $250 of credit).\n\nSelf Supervision for Image Encoding\n\nSo, the data collection pipeline is feeding new data into some files and we want to train on that in a self-supervised way (since this allows the encoder model to remain task agnostic). If you're interested, here's the wandb logs .\n\nModel Architecture\n\nWe train a Vision Transformer -based architecture on 576x960 resolution images. We replace normal attention (which scales poorly with many tokens) with Nystrom-based attention . This allows us to approximate self-attention with O(n) memory complexity (rather than O(n^2) with normal attention). This is necessary since we do not know our downstream task and so we must maintain high-resolution images. Our best model has a token dimension of 1024, a depth of 10, 10 heads, and 256 landmarks. If you'd like to compare it to existing models, it's a bit in between ViT-S and ViT-B\n\nTraining Scheme\n\nWe use the Masked Autoencoders Are Scalable Vision Learners paper to establish our approach for self-supervision. As seen in the graphic below:\n\nThis approach masks regions of the image and provides the image encoder with the non-masked regions. The image encoder builds a strong encoding then passes those tokens to a decoder, which predicts the masked regions. We mask 70% of our patches. The best model was around 80M parameters, as well as an extra 30M for the decoder part (which is only needed when training the self-supervised model).\n\nLogistics\n\nWe train on 4xA100 for 1.5 hours. Our model was still improving but you gotta move fast during a hackathon so I spent less time on hyperparameter tuning.\n\nFine Tuned Heads\n\nThe fine-tuned head can be adjusted depending on the task. We only train on predicting the number of people in an image as well as predicting the time of day. These heads were about 2M parameters. We did not have time to ablate the head size but I strongly suspect it could be reduced drastically (5% of current size or less) for simple tasks like those above."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"In no particular order:\n\nI did not know bash or ffmpeg very well, so I was a bit of a struggle to get that to download files from a YouTube live stream. My original uploads to Scale.ai did not include the original image path in the metadata, so when I downloaded the labeled results, I was unable to link them back to my local images :(. I created a new dataset and included the image path in the metadata. -There is an extremely fine balance between the size of patches and the number of patches. Generally, more (and thus smaller) patches are better (since you can represent more complexity). However, this still makes our memory and training footprint prohibitively larger. On the other hand, if the patches are too big we also run the risk of masking out an entire person, which would be impossible for the model to reconstruct and lead to poor encoding representation. It took a lot of fine-tuning. -My lack of desire to tune hyperparameters early meant I wasted a very long time with a very bad learning rate -I planned to feed these encodings into a DETR architecture to perform object/bounding box detection but I didn't have time. It isn't hard, but the DETR paper is more time-consuming to implement than I originally expected."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"I truly believe this idea holds significant merit for a future of performing efficient inference. It has its faults- relying on some data center to serve model encodings introduces latency that may not be possible in some applications (see: self-driving vehicles). However, the benefit of executing upwards of 99% of your FLOPs in a location where it can be 40x more efficient should not be understated.\n\nThis model shows extremely high generalization capacity.\n\nThe two tasks we do fine-tune on are time (of day) prediction and a number of people (a stand-in for bound box prediction). For time of day, we train on 300 samples and are able to generally predict the time of day within 15 minutes (though, all of the data was collected over the weekend, so there's probably some overfitting occurring since the test and train set are from the same day.). For a number of people, we train on only 30 samples and are able to get an average error of about .7 people! This is absolutely amazing considering how well the embedding of only 512 numbers was able to describe the 1.6M pixel values in an original image.\n\nThe automated data pipeline is extremely smooth. It felt very nice to be working on other tasks while collecting data, creating batches, and getting those batches labeled at the same time."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"A ton about Bash and Flask. I learned what Scale.ai actually does, which was really fun. I learned a significant amount about the efficiency of models and, maybe more importantly, the inefficiencies. It was quite shocking for me to read that usually only 10% of the energy spent on a model was during training."},{"heading":"What's next for Fine Tuned Heads","content":"I really want to see how well the object detection works with only encodings. Theoretically, it should be fine, since these embeddings are strong enough to (almost perfectly) reconstruct the original image, so the information on where people are in the image is clearly present.\n\nAutomating more of the process would be the next major step. Currently, the 'datacenter' is a DGX A100, which honestly is a pretty killer data center but it could be on a TPU, further increasing efficiency.\n\nLooking extremely long-term, a major question becomes how to keep the self-supervised model up to date. Consistent 'fine-tuning' with new data should prevent too much data drift, but every time you fine-tune the self-supervised model you need to retrain all of the prediction heads (which, granted, is quite easy as fast). I believe this can be solved with some codebook solutions like that seen in VQ-VAE2, but I'd have to think about it more."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bash flask python pytorch scale scale.ai"}]},{"project_title":"Ride Along","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/ride-along-ybclu1","tagline":"Ride Along is an environmentally friendly rideshare app that connects drivers and carpooling passengers.

Little, however, is talked about the effects of healthy eating habits on the production of neurotransmitters and mental health outcomes. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that help the brain communicate information across multiple neurostructures. Dietary habits play an important role in the production of neurotransmitters as they provide molecules (in the form of nutrients, for example) that favor the production of certain behaviors. In short, some neurotransmitters favor the expression of certain behaviors and mood changes, therefore, dietary habits can play a role in how humans behave and interact with the world. Our idea is based on very recent, innovative neuroscience research that is working to understand the hidden ways in which neurotransmitters contribute to humans’ wellbeing. Showing people how their dietary habits influence their behavior and mood change is beneficial because it creates a channel for change and improvement in habits. A poor diet has been scientifically linked to the development of mental and physical discomfort.

Our app also provides a quick environmental report to the user, showing how the production of that food item affected Carbon emissions. This is especially important as visualizing this type of data in a simple way can be a powerful incentive for people to change their habits. Our app uses data backed up by neuroscience research to assess food items and tell users that they might see a certain type of mood change as a result of consuming that particular meal. Eating a burger, for example, might lead to an increase in the brain’s production of dopamine receptors, which translates to a person feeling pleasure and satisfaction. Over a short period of time, however, that satisfaction turns into a sensation of lethargy and tiredness, which is characteristic of consumption of food that is high in fat and sugar. Our app will identify the burger (or whatever they are eating) and show the user how they might feel shortly as a result of that intake. Some fruits and vegetables are known for increasing attention and the ability to learn new skills. When somebody sees that information through our app, they might become naturally inclined to eating more healthy items as an outcome of having that information about food benefit fresh in their brain.

You are having a lovely time, but suddenly you notice a batch of red welts, swollen lips, and itchy throat. Worried and scared, you rush to the hospital just to realize that you will have to wait for another 3 hours to see a doctor due to the excess crowd.\n\nNow imagine that you could quickly talk to a medical professional who could recommend going to urgent care instead to treat your allergic reaction. Or, if you were recommended to seek emergency hospital care, you could see the estimated wait times at different hospitals before you left. Such a system would allow you to get advice from a medical professional quickly, save time waiting for treatment, and decrease your risk of COVID exposure by allowing you to avoid large crowds."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Our project aims to address three main areas of healthcare improvement. First, there is no easy way for an individual to know how crowded a hospital will be at a given time. Especially in the current pandemic environment, users would benefit from information such as crowd level and estimated travel times to different hospitals near them. Knowing this information would help them avoid unnecessary crowds and the risk of COVID19 exposure and receive faster medical attention and enhanced treatment experience. Additionally, such a system allows hospital staff to operate more effectively and begin triaging earlier since they will receive a heads-up about incoming (non-ambulance) patients before they arrive.\n\nSecond, online information is often unreliable, and specific demographics may not have access to a primary care provider to ask for advice during an emergency. Our interface allows users to access on-call tele-network services specific to their symptoms easily and therefore receive advice about options such as monitoring at home, urgent care, or an emergency hospital.\n\nThird, not knowing what to expect contributes to the elevated stress levels surrounding an emergency. Having an app service that encourages users to actively engage in health monitoring and providing tips about what to expect and how to prepare in an emergency will make users better equipped to handle these situations when they occur. Our dashboard offers tools such as a check-in journal to log their mood gratitudes and vent about frustrations. The entries are sent for sentiment analysis to help monitor mental states and offer support. Additionally, the dashboard allows providers to assign goals to patients and monitor progress (for example, taking antibiotics every day for 1 week or not smoking). Furthermore, the user can track upcoming medical appointments and access key medical data quickly (COVID19 vaccination card, immunization forms, health insurance)."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our application consists of a main front end and a backend. The front end was built using the Bubble.io interface. Within the Bubble service, we set up a database to store user profile information, create emergency events, and accumulate user inputs and goals. The Bubble Design tab and connection to various API’s allowed us to develop different pages to represent the functionalities and tools we needed. For example, we had a user login page, voice recording and symptom input page, emergency event trigger with dynamic map page, and dashboard with journaling and calendar schedule page. The Bubble Workflow tab allowed us to easily connect these pages and communicate information between the front and back end. The back end was built using Python Flask. We also used Dialogflow to map the symptoms with the doctor's speciality the user should visit. We processed data calls to InterSystems API in the backend server and processed data from the front end. We created synthetic data to test on."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This project was a great learning experience, and we had a lot of fun (and frustration) working through many challenges. First, we needed to spend time coming up with a project idea and then refining the scope of our idea. To do this, we talked with various sponsors and mentors to get feedback on our proposal and learn about the industry and actual needs of patients. Once we had a good roadmap for what features we wanted, we had to find data that we could use. Currently, hospitals are not required to provide any information about estimated wait time, so we had to find an alternative way to assess this. We decided to address this by developing our own heuristic that considers hospital distance, number of beds, and historic traffic estimation. This is a core functionality of our project, but also the most difficult, and we are still working on optimizing this metric. Another significant challenge we ran into was learning how to use the Bubble service, explicitly setting up the google maps functionality we wanted and connecting the backend with the frontend through Bubbles API. We sought mentor help, and are still trying to debug this step. Another ongoing challenge is implementing the call a doc feature with Twilio API. Finally, our team consists of members from drastically different time zones. So we needed to be proactive about scheduling meetings and communicating progress and tasks."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of our idea - indeed the amount of passion put into developing this toolkit to solve a meaningful problem is something very special (Thank you TreeHacks!).

When a user visits a menu, we load the menu items from our own database, load their allergies from IRIS, cross-reference the two, and display a menu with appropriately dangerous dishes flagged. Users can also add and delete allergies because those requests are passed through our system to IRIS.\n\nOur IRIS deployment is running on AWS.

Accecity was developed with several ethical considerations in mind to address a potentially murky future at the intersection of everyday life (especially within our civilian infrastructure) and digital technology.\n\nA primary lens we used to assist in our data collection and model training efforts was ensuring that we collected data points from a spectrum of different fields. We attempted to incorporate demographic, socioeconomic, and geopolitical diversity when developing our models to detect violations of the ADA. This is key, as studies have shown that ADA violations disproportionately affect socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, especially among Black and brown minorities.\n\nBy incorporating a diverse spectrum of information into our analysis, our outputs can also better serve the city and urban planners seeking to create more equitable access to cities for persons with disabilities and improve general walkability metrics.\n\nAt its core, AcceCity is meant to help urban planners design better cities. However, given the nature of our technology, it casts a wide, automatic net over certain regions. The voice of the end population is never heard, as all of our suggestion points are generated via Google Maps. In future iterations of our product, we would focus on implementing features that allow everyday civilians affected by ADA violations and lack of walkability to suggest changes to their cities or report concerns. People would have more trust in our product if they believe and see that it is truly creating a better city and neighborhood around them.\n\nAs we develop a technology that might revolutionize how cities approach urban planning and infrastructure budget, it is also important to consider how bad actors might aim to abuse our platform. The first and primary red flag is from the stance of someone who might abuse disability and reserved parking and actively seeks out those reserved spaces, when they have not applied for a disability placard, excluding those who need those spaces the most. Additionally, malicious actors might use the platform to scrape data on cities and general urban accessibility features and sell that data to firms that would want these kinds of metrics, which is why we firmly commit to securing our and never selling our data to third parties.\n\nOne final consideration for our product is its end goal: to help cities become more accessible for all. Once we achieve this goal, even on an individual concern by concern basis we should come back to cities and urban planners with information on the status of their improvements and more details on other places that they can attempt to create more equitable infrastructure."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"firebase flask mage nextjs openai python react scale tailwindcss"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com youtu.be youtu.be"}]},{"project_title":"Munch Buddies!","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/munch-buddies","tagline":"The goal of Munch Buddies is to promote healthy eating and mental wellness through a fun UI, along with providing users a little bit of nutrition info as well :)","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/843/676/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"TreeHacks 2022","hackathon_url":"https://treehacks-2022.devpost.com/","prize_name":"(Otsuka Valuenex) Otsuka Valuenex Wellbeing Innovation Challenge"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"expo.io","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/expo-io"},{"name":"fastapi","url":null},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react-native","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/matthewyangcs/munch-buddies"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"The Boring Stuff (Intro)","content":"Christina Zhao - 1st-time hacker - aka \"Is cucumber a fruit\" Peng Lu - 2nd-time hacker - aka \"Why is this not working!!\" x 30 Matthew Yang - ML specialist - aka \"What is an API\""},{"heading":"What it does","content":"It's a cross-platform app that can promote mental health and healthier eating habits!\n\nLog when you eat healthy food.

Given the severe global warming conditions, we believe that we can all do better, starting with changing our shopping habits. With economic incentives, visualization of personal carbon footprints, and gamification of the “shop greener” process, Tresure, is pushing people to shop greener and encouraging companies to reduce carbon emissions."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Cashback on green transactions\n\nBy partnering with companies with low carbon emissions, Tresure, acts as a platform to attract customers to buy greener products and to help customers earn cashback for each purchase from certified green companies. The cashback comes from a portion of the commission Tresure collects from certified green companies.\n\nVisualize carbon footprints\n\nWith permission to access users’ transactions data, either by linking to their bank account or credit card transactions history, Tresure uses third-party APIs to convert users’ transaction data into carbon footprints. Tresure then organizes and visualizes personal carbon footprints to help users keep track of their habits of consumption and make better choices.\n\nGamification\n\nIn addition to changing habits to fight climate change, we want to introduce entertaining elements into our app to make the process more fun and enjoyable. Therefore, we decided to gamify greener shopping to attract more people to join. With every green purchase, we plant cute trees in the app to symbolize that the user is making better choices. We would like to add a feature integrated with the game for users to donate part of their cashback to grow a real tree in the future.\n\nPersonalized Advertisement\n\nAs an affiliate marketing partner of green companies, Tresure incentivizes companies to decarbonize by promoting their green products and improving their image through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) advertisement. This service will not only encourage companies to go greener, but also creates another channel of revenue for our platform. In the future, we plan to integrate with carbon measurement platforms like Watershed to power our company collaborations."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started by brainstorming potential solutions to encourage customers to develop greener shopping habits.Then, we did competitor research and analysis. We found some mobile apps that can help users track their carbon footprints, such as MyEarth and Green Karma. However, we noticed that the main problem is that most people do not have a strong motivation to track and reduce their carbon footprints. As a solution, we built flow charts and user journey maps along with a business model that provides economic incentives to encourage people to go green. After refining the business model, we used bubble.io, a no-code development tool, to build a prototype for our mobile app. For calculation of carbon footprints, we leverage Mastercard carbon footprints calculator API to convert transaction data into carbon footprint."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Lack of data on companies' carbon emissions. We reached out to one of the sponsors Watershed, but they said that they cannot provide us with the database. We also found some online databases, but they are not free. We will need to pay in order to access these databases in the future, if needed. Lack of user transaction data. We will need to collect more user transaction data to test the compatibility of the third-party API with our app. Tracking the user transaction records through cookies needs to be done ethically, in partnership with the sponsor green companies. But, in order to present the shopping scenario for our users, we developed a prototype to mock the e-commerce website for Nike in our app."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"This is our first time participating in a Hackathon and coming into this, we did not have a lot of experience in web/mobile application development. It is truly a fulfilling experience to learn the concepts of how to use the software from scratch and to produce an app by the end of the hackathon. We are confident that this is an idea that can create a huge impact on a global level as it uses economic incentives to drive the behavior of people to make positive climate-conscious choices!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We got a great insight into the process of developing an app and building a prototype with the tools that are easily available on the internet. Using no-code development tools is a quick way to build a mobile app prototype. We also learned how to simplify seemingly complex ideas and to package them in an easily understandable and executable manner. We learned to look into the business aspects of our idea and come up with a revenue plan in a short amount of time."},{"heading":"What's next for Tresure","content":"A deeper market research to understand how the companies can seamlessly implement this idea of a “green marketplace” would be necessary since bringing a change at this level would likely be met with uncertainties. We would conduct user interviews to understand how the experience motivated them to care more about the cause. We would try to see if there was a sufficient “hook” on the app that the users wanted to keep using it. Finally, we want to use a “lean method” to rapidly build a prototype and test it. One of the things to do would be to dive deeper into the technical details of integrating the app with public APIs and other large databases. Other things would be to redesign the backend of the game feature and make it more attractive. We would also lay some of the groundwork for the success of our application by seeking potential partnerships from green companies."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api bubble"}]},{"project_title":"POC Diagnostics","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/universal-lfa-reader-for-poc-diagnostics","tagline":"Despite the fact that the covid-19 pandemic has downgraded.

But when we used the “and” function to try to find intersections with mental wellness, we found that none of those companies that offer a personalized plan really focused on either stress or mental health. This inspired us to create a service where we use a data-driven, personalized, nutritional approach to reduce stress."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We offer healthy recipe recommendations that are likely to reduce stress. We do this by looking at how the nutrients in the users’ past diets contributed to changes in stress. We combine this with their personal information to generate a model of which nutrients are likely to improve their mental wellness and recommend recipes that contain those nutrients. Most people do want to eat healthier, but they don’t because it is inconvenient and perceived to be less delicious. Our service makes it easy and convenient to eat delicious healthy food by making the recipe selection and ingredient collection processes simpler.\n\nTo personally tailor each user's recipe suggestions to their stress history, we have users save food items to their food log and fill out a daily questionnaire with common stress indicators. We then use the USDA food database to view the specific nutrients each food item has and use this data to calculate the relationship between the user's stress and the specific nutrients they consumed. Finally, we use this model to suggest future recipes that contain nutrients likely to reduce stress for that user.\n\nIn order to proactively reduce user's stress, we offer a simple interface to plan meals in advance for your entire week, an auto-generated ingredients list based on selected recipes for the week, and a seamless way to order and pay for the ingredients using the Checkbook API service. To make it easier for users, the food log will automatically populate each day with the ingredients from the recipes the user selected to eat for that day."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Bubble to build a no-code front end by dragging and dropping the design elements we needed. We used Bubble's USDA plugin to let users search for and enter foods that they consumed. The USDA food database is also used to determine the nutrients present in each of the foods the user reports consuming. We also used Bubble's Toolbox plugin to write Javascript code that allows us to run the Checkbook API. We use the Spoonacular API to get the recipe suggestions based on the user's personalized preference quiz answers where they give the types of cuisines they like and their dietary restrictions. We use a linear regression model to suggest future recipes for users based on the nutrients that are likely to reduce their stress."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One challenge for us was using Bubble. Only one team member had previous design experience, but everyone on the team wanted to contribute to building the front-end, so we faced a huge learning curve for all members of the team to learn about good design principles and how to space elements out on Bubble. Grouping elements together was sometimes weird on Bubble and caused issues with parts of our header not lining up the way we wanted it to. Elements would sometimes disappear under other elements and it would become hard to get them out. Formatting was weird because our laptops had different aspect ratios, so what looked good on one person's laptop looked bad on another person's laptop. We were debugging Bubble until the end of the hackathon."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Our team had little to no front-end design experience coming into this hackathon. We are proud of how much we all learned about front-end design through Bubble. We feel that moving forward, we can create better front-end designs for our future projects.\n\nWe are also proud of finding and figuring out how to use the Spoonacular API to get recipe recommendations. This API had very thorough documentation, so it was relatively easy to pick it up and figure out how to implement it."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"The first thing we learned was how to use the Otsuka valuenex visualization tool for ideation. We found this tool to be extremely helpful with our brainstorming process and when coming up with our idea.\n\nWe learned how to use Bubble to create a front-end without needing to write code. Despite the struggles we initially faced, we grew to find Bubble more intuitive and fun to use with more practice and managed to create a pretty nice front-end for our service. We hosted our server on Bubble.\n\nWe also learned how to use the Checkbook API to seamlessly send and receive payments.\n\nFinally, we learned how to use the Spoonacular API to generate recipe recommendations based on a set of parameters that includes preferred types of cuisines, dietary restrictions, and nutrients present in each dish."},{"heading":"What's next for mood food","content":"We feel very passionate about exploring this project in more depth by applying more complex machine learning models to determine better recipe recommendations for users.
