The content script detects Amazon product pages, triggers the backend API, and injects a sidebar iframe with the analysis UI. Used TypeScript for type safety and Tailwind CSS for styling.\n\nImplemented IndexedDB caching so repeat product views load instantly without hitting the API. The sidebar communicates with the content script via postMessage for security.\n\nBackend System\n\nPython FastAPI server with clean architecture (API/Domain/Infrastructure layers). When a product URL comes in:\n\nWeb Scraping : BeautifulSoup4 extracts product HTML with confidence scoring Data Extraction : Claude parses ingredients from HTML into structured JSON Safety Analysis : Claude Agent SDK with web search tool researches each ingredient Harm Calculation : Custom algorithm scores allergens (5-30 pts), PFAS (40 pts), and toxicity Caching : Results stored in Supabase PostgreSQL with 30-day TTL\n\nAI Agent Design\n\nUsed Claude Sonnet 4.5 with the Agent SDK's tool-calling feature. Claude can autonomously:\n\nSearch the web for ingredient safety data Cross-reference PFAS compound databases Identify allergen severity from medical sources Return structured JSON with confidence scores\n\nKey prompt engineering: I provide product data + allergen database, then Claude decides when to search for additional info vs. using provided data.\n\nDeployment Pipeline\n\nHosted on Google Cloud Run (serverless, auto-scaling). Set up CI/CD with Cloud Build triggers—every push to main automatically:\n\nBuilds Docker container Deploys to Cloud Run Updates environment variables from Secret Manager Goes live in ~3 minutes\n\nSecurity : API keys stored in Google Secret Manager, never in code.\n\nSystem Flow:\n\nUser visits Amazon → Content script detects page → FastAPI scrapes product → Claude extracts ingredients → Claude searches web for safety data → Custom algorithm calculates harm score (0-100) → Results cached in Supabase → Sidebar renders analysis with color-coded risk level → User makes informed decision"},{"heading":"🎓 What I Learned","content":"1. AI Agent Orchestration\n\nWorking with Claude's Agent SDK taught me how to design effective tool-calling workflows. I learned to balance autonomy (letting Claude search the web) with constraints (providing structured data schemas).\n\nKey Insight : The best agent systems combine high-level autonomy with well-defined output schemas. I give Claude freedom to search and reason, but require JSON responses with specific fields.\n\n2. Chrome Extension Architecture\n\nManifest V3 forced me to rethink state management—service workers terminate aggressively, so I implemented IndexedDB caching and message passing between content scripts and iframes.\n\nKey Insight : Content scripts should be minimal and isolated. All heavy logic lives in the sidebar iframe, communicating via postMessage. This avoids bundling issues and page conflicts.\n\n3. Web Scraping at Scale\n\nAmazon's HTML is complex and varies by product type. I built a confidence scoring system that determines when scraping succeeded vs. when to fall back to Claude fetching the page directly.\n\nKey Insight : Never trust scraped data blindly. Implement confidence metrics (found title? brand? ingredients?) to validate data quality before processing.\n\n4. Clean Architecture Benefits\n\nSeparating domain logic (harm calculation) from infrastructure (database, AI) made the codebase incredibly maintainable. I could swap out the AI model or database without touching business logic.\n\nKey Insight : The extra upfront effort of clean architecture pays off immediately. I refactored the AI provider twice without touching harm calculation code.\n\n5. Production DevOps\n\nDeployed a production system with:\n\nAutomatic deployments via Cloud Build triggers Secret management for API keys Serverless auto-scaling Database migrations with Supabase\n\nKey Insight : Infrastructure-as-code and CI/CD aren't just nice-to-have—they're essential for rapid iteration. I can push to GitHub and have changes live in 3 minutes."},{"heading":"🚧 Challenges I Faced","content":"Challenge 1: Amazon Anti-Scraping Measures\n\nProblem : Amazon blocks bots and returns different HTML structures depending on region, product category, and user agent.\n\nSolution : Implemented a three-tier approach:\n\nRotating user agents with realistic browser headers Confidence scoring to validate data quality Fallback to Claude's web_fetch tool when scraping fails\n\nThis hybrid approach achieves 85% scraping success rate, with Claude handling the remaining 15%.\n\nChallenge 2: Extension Content Script Isolation\n\nProblem : Content scripts run in isolated contexts—can't easily share data with sidebar UI. Can't import npm packages without bundling issues.\n\nSolution :\n\nUsed iframe + postMessage for secure communication Sidebar runs as a full Svelte app inside iframe Content script stays minimal (no imports, inline utilities) Data flows: Content Script → postMessage → Sidebar Iframe\n\nChallenge 3: AI Cost & Latency\n\nProblem : Each analysis costs $0.02-0.18 and takes 10-15 seconds. At scale, this is expensive and slow.\n\nSolution :\n\nAggressive caching : PostgreSQL with 30-day TTL Hash-based deduplication : Same URL = same hash = cache hit Optimized prompts : Reduced tokens by 40% through prompt engineering Two-stage approach : Only use expensive agent mode when scraped data has low confidence Prefetching : Start analysis on page load, not on button click\n\nResult: 90% cache hit rate on popular products, <500ms response time when cached.\n\nChallenge 4: Harm Score Calibration\n\nProblem : How do you turn \"contains retinol\" into a meaningful 0-100 score that feels intuitive to users?\n\nSolution :\n\nResearched toxicology databases (NIH, EPA, FDA) Consulted allergen severity rankings from medical literature Built weighted scoring system with category multipliers Tested on 50+ real products to calibrate thresholds Iterated based on \"does this score feel right?\" gut checks\n\nFinal thresholds:\n\n0-29: Low risk (green) 30-59: Medium risk (yellow) 60-100: High risk (red)\n\nChallenge 5: Real-Time Performance\n\nProblem : Users expect instant results when clicking the trigger button. Network latency + AI processing = 10-15 second wait.\n\nSolution :\n\nPrefetch on page load : Start analysis before user clicks (optimistic) Loading states : Beautiful animated donut chart with progress Optimistic UI : Show cached data instantly while fetching updates API optimization : Reduced P95 latency from 12s to 2s (cached)\n\nChallenge 6: Maintaining Type Safety\n\nProblem : Data flows through 4 layers (Extension → API → Claude → Database) with different type systems.\n\nSolution :\n\nPydantic models in Python for API validation TypeScript interfaces in extension for compile-time safety Shared schema documentation in CLAUDE.md Runtime validation at API boundaries\n\nResult: Zero runtime type errors in production."},{"heading":"🎯 What's Next for Ruh","content":"Medium-term (3-6 months):\n\nAlternative Product Recommendations - AI finds safer alternatives with Amazon affiliate links User Accounts - Save personal allergen profiles across devices Browser Extension Polish - Improved animations and error states Multi-Platform Support - Expand to Target, Walmart, Whole Foods, iHerb Community Validation - User-submitted ingredient corrections and reviews\n\nLong-term (6-12 months):\n\nRegulatory Data Integration - FDA recalls, EPA warnings, EU bans Personalized Risk Profiles - Machine learning on user preferences B2B API - License safety analysis to e-commerce platforms"},{"heading":"🏆 Why This Matters","content":"The Problem:\n\nMillions of people have food allergies PFAS chemicals are in 99% of the world population's bloodstreams Consumers spend 15+ minutes researching product safety before purchases No centralized tool exists for real-time ingredient analysis\n\nThe Impact: Ruh democratizes product safety analysis—putting laboratory-grade ingredient analysis in everyone's pocket, at the moment they're making purchasing decisions.\n\nTarget Users:\n\nParents shopping for children's products People with allergies or chemical sensitivities Health-conscious consumers Anyone concerned about \"forever chemicals\"\n\nMarket Opportunity:\n\n60M+ allergy sufferers in the US and Canada $250B+ US e-commerce market Growing consumer demand for transparency Potential for affiliate revenue on recommended alternatives"},{"heading":"🔧 Built With","content":"Languages & Frameworks:\n\nPython 3.13 - Backend API development TypeScript 5.3 - Type-safe extension development Svelte 5 - Reactive UI framework FastAPI - High-performance async Python web framework\n\nAI & Machine Learning:\n\nAnthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5 - Latest frontier model Claude Agent SDK - Tool-calling and agentic workflows Anthropic API - AI service integration\n\nFrontend Technologies:\n\nVite - Next-generation build tooling Tailwind CSS - Utility-first styling IndexedDB (idb library) - Client-side persistence Chrome Extension Manifest V3 - Modern extension platform\n\nBackend Technologies:\n\nFastAPI - Modern Python web framework httpx - Async HTTP client BeautifulSoup4 + lxml - HTML parsing Pydantic - Data validation and settings uvicorn - ASGI server\n\nCloud & Infrastructure:\n\nGoogle Cloud Run - Serverless container platform Google Cloud Build - CI/CD automation Google Secret Manager - Secure credential storage Supabase - PostgreSQL database with real-time features GitHub Actions - Workflow automation\n\nAPIs & Services:\n\nAnthropic Claude API - AI analysis with built-in web search Supabase REST API - Database operations Amazon.com - Product data (web scraping)\n\nDevelopment Tools:\n\nuv - Fast Python package manager npm - Node package manager Git/GitHub - Version control Docker - Containerization"},{"heading":"🔗 Links","content":"GitHub Repository : https://github.com/RSHVR/ruh Live Demo : [Chrome Extension - Load Unpacked] or find it on the Chrome Extension Store once it's approved: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/mjgicecpbfabjaebiaioaijelbepihcl?utm_source=item-share-cb\n\nBuilt with ❤️ by Arshveer Gahir"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"beautiful-soup claude-agent-sdk docker fastapi google-cloud pydantic python supabase svelte tailwind-css typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"chromewebstore.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"HI-FI: Human Intelligence for Financial Independence","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/hi-fi-human-intelligence-for-financial-independence","tagline":"Meet HI-FI, your Financial Ed buddy app that seals your holed pockets, while letting you go to parties.

Students get lists of 500 scholarships they might qualify for, but almost none help them actually succeed in those applications.\n\nWhat struck us most was the hidden gap between what scholarships claim to value publicly and where they're actually headed strategically. A merit foundation might emphasize GPA, but internally they're pivoting toward innovation and social entrepreneurship. Students writing generic essays aligned with yesterday's priorities are competing at a disadvantage.\n\nThe second inspiration came from watching brilliant students systematically undervalue themselves—minimizing authentic achievements with qualifiers like \"I just helped organize...\" or \"I only managed to...\" We observed this pattern so pervasively it seemed cultural. Humility is an amazing trait that helps students collaborate and succeed but hurts them in the application process. These students possessed real strengths they couldn't see, and they lacked tools to ethically extract and amplify their value.\n\nThis convergence led to our core question: What if AI could bridge the gap between where organizations are heading and authentic student value?"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"QuillCoach is a strategic positioning engine for scholarship applications that operates in four phases:\n\nScholarship Intelligence analyzes the organization behind the scholarship—extracting strategic priorities, future direction, and organizational momentum from research and official documents.\n\nStudent Profile Analysis helps students identify their authentic strengths, flagging areas where they're minimizing genuine achievements and asking them to verify that any reframing feels honest.\n\nStrategic Essay Generation creates tailored essays that answer the actual prompt while emphasizing the student's strengths most relevant to what the organization actually values (not what it claims to value).\n\nComparative Analysis shows the before-and-after impact—demonstrating how strategic positioning amplifies an authentic story without fabricating anything.\n\nThe ethical core is built into the system: reframe without exaggerating, amplify without inventing, and keep students in control of authenticity boundaries throughout.\n\nHow we built it\n\nQuillCoach was built using Hampshire County AI's AI App Ideator, a thinking-first app generator we created to solve a critical problem in AI-assisted development. We noticed that most app generation tools encourage developers to jump straight from rough ideas to code—essentially generating apps from a couple paragraphs. This approach produces technically functional applications that miss the deeper strategic thinking required to build something meaningful. The AI App Ideator inverts this process: spend substantial time articulating vision, values, stakeholder needs, real-world impact, and business logic before generating a single line of code.\n\nWe used this methodology to build QuillCoach, which meant the technical specification became the creative crucible where we solved the hardest conceptual problems.\n\nThinking through the organizational intelligence challenge : Our initial concept assumed we could simply extract strategic priorities from organizational websites and documents. But when we refined the technical specification, we realized this approach had a critical flaw—it would capture what organizations claim to prioritize, not what they actually value. We revised the spec to require the AI to search for and integrate public quotes from organizational leaders, recent initiatives they've championed, and board-level strategic pivots. This distinction between stated values and demonstrated priorities became foundational to QuillCoach's entire intelligence layer.\n\nSolving the student minimization problem : The technical specification initially framed the student profile analysis as simple achievement extraction—just list what they've accomplished. But through iterative refinement, we recognized this would amplify the exact problem we're trying to solve. Students minimize their achievements in how they describe them; simply extracting their self-written descriptions perpetuates that minimization. We revised the specification to require a two-step intelligence process: first, the AI analyzes student inputs to extract hidden value —recognizing patterns of minimization, reframing accomplishments in terms of impact and leadership, identifying strengths the student didn't explicitly articulate. Second, and crucially, we built in an authenticity verification layer where students actively confirm that these reframings feel honest to them. This puts the student back in control and prevents the AI from inflating their profile.\n\nDesigning strategic positioning with ethical boundaries : The essay generation specification required careful thought about how to integrate organizational intelligence with student strengths without crossing into manipulation. We spent significant effort refining the prompt structure to ensure the AI understood the hierarchy: the student's authentic verified strengths come first, the organizational priorities come second, and strategic emphasis emerges from the intersection of these two, not from fabricating relevance where it doesn't exist. We explicitly built constraints into the technical specification prohibiting the system from inventing experiences, exaggerating impact, or claiming connections that don't exist.\n\nBuilding the verification workflow : Rather than assuming AI analysis would be reliable enough to proceed directly to essay generation, we designed a three-phase workflow into the technical specification. The Review phase presents the AI's analysis passively. The Verify phase asks concrete authenticity questions (\"Did you actually initiate this initiative?\" \"Would you confidently discuss this in an interview?\"). The Confirm phase requires explicit student commitment before proceeding. This distributed verification approach became more important than any single technical component—it's where the system's ethics actually live.\n\nOnce the technical specification precisely captured our vision—with all these refinements embedded—we used the AI App Ideator to generate the application. The generator handles the implementation details: button styling, font selection, layout decisions, component architecture, state management. But these choices aren't arbitrary—they're informed by the deep work we did in the specification. We chose serif headlines because they convey the trust and sophistication that an ethical AI tool requires. Monospace accents signal technical rigor. Bold gradients make strategic positioning feel empowering rather than manipulative. Step indicators reduce cognitive load as students progress through phases. These design choices emerge from our conceptual clarity, not from aesthetic preference.\n\nThe entire codebase—both the AI App Ideator and QuillCoach—is publicly available on Hampshire County AI's Github. The AI App Ideator itself is live on Poe at https://poe.com/AI_App_Ideator , so anyone can use it to build their own applications with the same thinking-first methodology, or remix our approach for their own ideas.\n\nThis is what distinguishes our process: we didn't generate an app quickly and then iterate. We thought deeply about the problem, refined the technical specification until it captured that thinking precisely, and then generated the application to realize that vision. The AI handled implementation; we handled strategy and ethics. This division of labor—where human thinking precedes and shapes AI generation—is what we believe makes QuillCoach genuinely useful rather than merely functional."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Detecting minimization without overfitting : Teaching AI to distinguish genuine humility from false modesty required building the student-verification layer as the core safeguard. The AI makes tentative identifications; students confirm authenticity.\n\nOrganizational research hallucination : When prompting Claude to extract strategic direction, there's real risk of fabricated quotes or invented initiatives. We solved this with strict prompt boundaries that clearly indicate confidence levels and avoid fabrication.\n\nBalancing optimization with ethics : There's a slippery slope from helping students emphasize strengths to helping them manipulate. We built this directly into system design—no fabrication allowed, explicit student confirmation required, transparent explanations of strategic choices, and comfort zone controls.\n\nMulti-context prompt engineering : Integrating organizational intelligence, student strengths, specific essay prompts, and strategic emphasis without losing coherence required layered context injection with clear boundaries between each type of information.\n\nDemonstrating impact at hackathon scale : The system's real value emerges over time seeing scholarship wins. We solved this by building comparative analysis that shows before/after essays with explicit strategic explanations and hypothetical success probability."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Building a system that treats responsible AI as a core feature, not an afterthought.

Each layer requires different AI techniques and human oversight.\n\nAuthenticity safeguards architecture : Preventing false inflation requires bidirectional verification where students confirm reframings, comfort zone management where students set their own boundaries, and distributed checkpoints throughout the workflow rather than a single gate.\n\nThe power of understanding actual priorities : When you truly understand what an organization values (not what it claims to value), strategic positioning becomes honest rather than manipulative. You're answering the real question, not the stated one.\n\nMost importantly : The most powerful AI tools don't maximize outcomes at the cost of ethics—they align outcomes with integrity. Students don't need help fabricating themselves. They need help seeing themselves clearly and positioning their authentic selves strategically.\n\n## What's next for QuillCoach QuillCoach is launching through three simultaneous growth tracks, each building toward sustainable scale. **Local Launch (Immediate)**: We're embedding QuillCoach into Hampshire County's existing educational infrastructure—the Hampshire County Public Library's STREAM Club AI programming and the Family Support Center's upcoming AI event for teens. Rather than pushing the app to individual users, we're running hands-on consulting sessions where our volunteers guide students through the application using the Poe interface. This approach serves dual purposes: we get real user feedback in a supportive environment to refine the product and technical implementation, and we build a core group of student advocates and community partners who understand the value of what QuillCoach offers. These early adopters become our foundation for broader expansion. **Regional Expansion (Before December Break)**: We're marketing QuillCoach across DC, Maryland, and Virginia through educational organizations, scholarship networks, and student support programs. The timing is strategic—winter break is when students actually sit down to work on scholarship applications. Regional users will access QuillCoach directly through their own Poe accounts, giving us visibility into adoption patterns, user engagement, and which features drive the most impact. This phase generates the data and case studies we need to demonstrate market demand. **National Scale (Active Partner Search)**: We're actively seeking a technical co-founder and operations partner to launch QuillCoach as a standalone platform. The core innovation—our thinking-first approach to strategic positioning, the organizational intelligence layer, the authenticity verification workflow—can live in any AI-enabled system. We're offering a validated product with regional traction, open-source code ready to build on, a clear market opportunity in the scholarship space, and a proven methodology (the AI App Ideator) for responsible AI development. The right partner would handle technology infrastructure, API economics, user acquisition, and go-to-market strategy. This is an opportunity to build something that scales nationally while maintaining the ethical principles that make QuillCoach genuinely helpful rather than manipulative. These tracks run in parallel and reinforce each other. Local success generates evidence of impact. Regional traction demonstrates demand and reveals optimization opportunities. Both become assets in conversations with potential co-founders. Hampshire County AI's core mission remains supporting AI training and development locally, but QuillCoach represents an opportunity to scale that mission—and the thinking-first methodology behind it—far beyond our region."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ai-app-ideator claude-haiku-4.5 claude-sonnet-4.5 css html poe.com tailwind"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"poe.com github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:04:07.541666Z"}}
