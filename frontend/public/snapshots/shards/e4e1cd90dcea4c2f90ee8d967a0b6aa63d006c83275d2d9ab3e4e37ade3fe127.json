Today, it's the one who can ask the best questions. Yet, modern classrooms rely on static, disconnected tools - slides, whiteboards, and notes - that fail to capture the dynamic nature of human learning.\n\nStudents today juggle lecture slides, notes, videos, and AI tools across different tabs - a fragmented experience that slows real understanding. While LLMs and note-taking tools help, they rarely adapt to how each student actually learns. Many students struggle with passive, screen-based learning experiences - especially neurodiverse or physically limited learners. We wanted to design a tool that makes studying more accessible, tactile, and interactive, enabling learning through movement, speech, and visualization.\n\nWe built MindPad to reintroduce that magic - helping students think, speak, and learn like humans, not machines."},{"heading":"🪄 What it does","content":"MindPad is an AI-powered study and exploration platform that helps students learn, revise, and understand course material through gestures, voice, and an intelligent interactive canvas.\n\nUsing advanced computer-vision and language-model technology, MindPad blends gesture recognition, voice interaction, and an AI-powered canvas into one seamless experience. MindPad lets students:\n\nInteract Hands-Free: Use real-time hand-gesture recognition (OpenCV + MediaPipe + custom ANN for detection + classification) to navigate slides, highlight key points, or sketch diagrams on the AI canvas without touching a device. Learn by Talking: Speak naturally to the OpenAI Agent SDK-based voice agent to ask questions, generate examples, or request diagrams and clarifications during study sessions. Understand Through Visualization: The intelligent canvas can automatically draw charts, concept maps, and summaries in real time from lecture transcripts or uploaded PDFs for more engaging learning experiences. Promote Kinesthetic Learning: Encourages active engagement by letting students interact physically with course content through gestures: proven to improve comprehension and memory retention. Enhance Accessibility: Designed with a touch-free interface for students with motor or mobility challenges, allowing voice-first and gesture-only navigation. Together, these tools turn passive reading into active multimodal learning."},{"heading":"⚙️ How we built it","content":"Architecture Model: (in our gallery)\n\nLanguages: Python ∙ HTML ∙ CSS ∙ TypeScript\n\nFrameworks and Tools: OpenCV ∙ MediaPipe ∙ PyAutoGUI ∙ Pynput ∙ OpenAI Agent SDK ∙ Figma ∙ Custom ANN\n\n1. Gesture Recognition and Classification\n\nWe built a real-time gesture detection and control pipeline using OpenCV and MediaPipe. Landmark Extraction: MediaPipe captures and tracks 21 hand landmarks per frame. Feature Engineering: We calculate pairwise distances and angles between key landmarks to generate gesture vectors. Classification Model: A custom Artificial Neural Network (ANN) trained on labeled gesture datasets classifies gestures (e.g., scroll, tap, annotate). System Control: Classified gestures are mapped to PyAutoGUI and Pynput actions, enabling users to perform mouse clicks, slide navigation, or drawing without touching a device. This pipeline runs in under 200ms latency and achieves 99% classification accuracy on test gestures.\n\n2. Voice Agent Integration\n\nTo make interaction natural and multimodal, we integrated a voice-driven AI assistant using the OpenAI Agent SDK. The agent performs tool-calling for real-time tasks: generating charts, summarizing concepts, or writing on the web-based canvas. Spoken queries are transcribed, processed, and passed through the OpenAI API. The agent determines whether to generate text, draw a figure, or retrieve lecture material, returning the result seamlessly to the user interface.\n\n3. Web-Based Intelligent Canvas\n\nThe core of MindPad’s user experience: supports gesture-based drawing, AI annotations, and voice-generated content. Students can ask the agent to \"draw a graph,\" \"summarize this chapter,\" or \"create a concept map,\" and the canvas updates dynamically. This layer connects all input modes - gesture, voice, and knowledge - into one synchronized workspace.\n\n4. Frontend and UI/UX Design\n\nWe used HTML/CSS/Figma to design an intuitive, distraction-free interface optimized for learning. Smooth animations and transitions ensure gesture and voice interactions feel organic. We implemented adjustable gesture sensitivity, high-contrast UI themes, and multimodal input support to ensure accessibility for users with different learning and mobility needs."},{"heading":"⏳ Challenges we ran into","content":"Synchronizing gesture recognition, voice commands, and AI input in real-time Designing smooth hand gesture thresholds for accuracy and comfort Integrating OpenAI Agents with web-based rendering and tool calls Managing latency across multimodal pipelines"},{"heading":"🏆 Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Created an accessible, multimodal workspace that supports diverse learning styles - visual, auditory, and kinesthetic - making technology more human-centered.

Developing multimodal systems requires careful user-centric calibration, and we saw how even minor gesture differences make a world of a difference. We learned that accessibility and engagement go hand in hand, and that designing for kinesthetic and voice-based input not only improves inclusion but also enhances comprehension for all learners. When integrated right, multimodality helped us unlock creative, human-centered learning and improve focus and retention.\n\nOur biggest takeaway was that the future of education lies in adaptive, expressive learning interfaces that let students think beyond text."},{"heading":"🚀 What's next for MindPad","content":"Integrate MindPad with learning platforms like Notion, Canvas, and Google Classroom for direct lecture import Add personalized learning insights for students via emotion and engagement tracking to detect confusion and tailor feedback Expand accessibility features such as customizable gesture ranges, AR sign-language recognition, and real-time captioning for a fully inclusive learning environment Support collaborative study sessions via shared multimodal canvases"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ann css figma gemini-api html mediapipe openai-agent-sdk openai-api opencv pyautogui pynput python typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Watt's Up","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/watt-s-up","tagline":"An AI-driven sustainability platform that transforms rooftops into renewable power insights: revealing untapped solar potential, energy savings, and carbon reduction opportunities in seconds.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/946/342/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Overall Hack [Courtesy of Amplitude, Anthropic, OpenAI]"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"dedalus-labs-sdk","url":null},{"name":"google-gemini","url":null},{"name":"google-maps","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-maps"},{"name":"hugging-face","url":null},{"name":"nasa-power-api","url":null},{"name":"numpy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/numpy"},{"name":"opencv","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/opencv"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"segformer-b0","url":null},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"},{"name":"vite","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"watts-up.tech","url":"https://watts-up.tech/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/deepanshgandhi/Watts-Up"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We realized that most people genuinely want to adopt clean energy but they just don’t know where to start. The information gap between wanting solar and knowing if it’s worth it is surprisingly wide. Getting reliable estimates often means weeks of outreach, technical evaluations, and confusing data.\n\nAt the same time, satellite and irradiance data that could answer these questions already exist. They are just fragmented, technical, and inaccessible to the people who could use them most. That disconnect felt like both a technical challenge and a societal problem worth solving.\n\nSo we set out to build something simple but powerful: a tool where anyone, whether an individual, organization, or policymaker, can instantly see how much energy their roof could produce, how much they would save, and how much carbon they would offset, with no middlemen or guesswork.\n\nWatts Up was built with our belief that sustainability should be data driven, transparent, and easy to act on. If we can make people see rooftops not as static structures but as sources of untapped potential, we turn awareness into action."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Watts Up is an AI-powered solar intelligence platform that transforms any rooftop into a personalized clean-energy report in seconds. You start by entering an address and outlining the area of the roof you want to analyze. Once you click “Analyze Roof,” the platform uses satellite imagery, geospatial data, and AI-driven computer vision to evaluate how effectively that location can harness solar power.\n\nIn moments, Watts Up generates a detailed, interactive dashboard that shows:\n\nSolar Score : a performance rating indicating the site’s solar suitability. Energy Forecasts : estimated daily and annual generation based on NASA irradiance and climate data. System Insights : roof area, optimal panel configuration, and system capacity. Financial Outlook : installation cost, payback period, ROI, and long-term savings. Environmental Impact : projected carbon offset, CO₂ reduction, and tree-equivalent contribution. Savings Mirror : upload your monthly electricity bill to instantly compare current utility expenses with projected solar costs and savings, featuring visual breakdowns of payback timelines and cumulative ROI. Energy Equtiy & Access Index : built into the platform's policy recommendation reports, this feature introduces the WattsUp Equity Score (0-100), which measures disparities in solar adoption across income, zoning, and race demographics using Census and building data. The index helps identify underserved neighborhoods and informs city councils or NGOs seeking to target grants, rebates, or community solar programs.\n\nThe experience feels immediate, visual, and data-driven: replacing lengthy consultations with intelligent, automated insight.\n\nWatts Up combines creativity in design, depth in functionality, and a clear social mission: making clean energy adoption simple, accessible, and measurable. It’s a step toward a future where anyone can understand their renewable potential with a single click."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started by integrating the Google Maps API to allow users to input an address and draw their desired rooftop area directly on an interactive map. Once the region is defined, our backend pipeline processes it through a series of AI and data-driven stages.\n\nWe used NASA’s POWER API to gather solar irradiance, temperature, and climate data for the coordinates selected by the user. The imagery from Google Maps is then analyzed using SegFormer-B0 , a transformer-based model fine-tuned for rooftop segmentation. Through PyTorch and OpenCV , we calculate usable roof area, slope, and shading to estimate effective solar capture potential.\n\nThe system combines this information with performance and cost models to produce detailed metrics such as expected energy output, system size, cost savings, payback period, ROI, and CO₂ offsets. To make the experience intelligent and conversational, we used Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and the Dedalus Labs SDK (Claude Sonnet 4 agents) to power dynamic insights, localized incentive discovery, and report generation.\n\nThe frontend was built with React 18 , TypeScript 5.8 , and Vite 5.4 , focusing on a clean, fluid interface that visualizes complex data with simplicity and elegance. Every design choice: from the color gradients to the live performance metrics was crafted to make sustainability feel modern, interactive, and approachable.\n\nWe collaborated across design, data, and engineering to ensure every part of the product worked cohesively. The final result is a fully functional prototype that seamlessly blends geospatial analytics, AI, and climate intelligence into one accessible experience."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Building Watts Up required merging several complex systems: geospatial mapping, AI vision models, and climate data; into one seamless workflow. That came with its share of challenges.\n\nOne of the biggest hurdles was aligning NASA irradiance data with map coordinates in real time. Small projection mismatches created large accuracy errors, so we had to carefully calibrate and normalize the datasets for consistent results.\n\nAnother challenge was optimizing the computer vision pipeline . Segmenting rooftops from satellite imagery sounds simple, but varying roof angles, shading, and vegetation made detection difficult. We had to fine-tune SegFormer-B0 and post-process its masks with OpenCV to reach the 95% confidence level shown in our reports.\n\nWe also faced performance bottlenecks when running inference and generating solar analytics on the fly. To solve this, we implemented caching and lightweight data pipelines to keep the experience interactive and responsive.\n\nDesigning the user interface was equally challenging: balancing technical precision with visual clarity. We wanted to present data like ROI and carbon offsets in a way that feels intuitive and motivating, not overwhelming.\n\nIntegrating every part under pressure was demanding, but it reinforced our commitment to building solutions that are both technically sound and meaningful."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re proud that Watts Up evolved from an idea into a fully functional solar intelligence system within a short time frame.\n\nEnd-to-end integration: Built a working pipeline that combines Google Maps, NASA irradiance data, and AI-based roof segmentation into real-time solar analytics. Functional precision: Achieved over 95% accuracy in roof boundary detection and energy potential estimation using our computer vision pipeline. Interactive experience: Designed a clean, map-based interface that lets users draw, analyze, and visualize their rooftop potential in seconds. Scalable foundation: Structured the system so it can expand from single rooftops to city-wide or enterprise-scale energy mapping. Impact-driven design: Created a tool that not only demonstrates technical capability but also drives awareness and accessibility in renewable energy adoption, incorporating the idea of the Energy Equity & Access Index.\n\nThe most rewarding outcome was seeing the system deliver reliable, data-backed results that could realistically guide clean energy decisions."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Building Watts Up taught us how to bridge data science, geospatial analysis, and AI into a cohesive, real-world application.\n\nWe learned how to process and align datasets from different coordinate systems, how to fine-tune a transformer-based vision model for variable image quality, and how to optimize inference speed for real-time interactivity. Integrating APIs from Google Maps and NASA POWER required handling data normalization, unit conversion, and latency challenges that pushed us to think beyond standard pipelines.\n\nWe also gained a deeper understanding of the energy modeling side: translating irradiance and temperature data into practical metrics like kWh output, ROI, and carbon savings.\n\nOn a broader level, we learned that sustainability tech requires both technical precision and accessibility. Data alone isn’t enough; how it’s presented determines whether people act on it. That insight guided every design and engineering decision we made."},{"heading":"What's next for Watt's Up","content":"Watts Up began as a hackathon project, but it quickly became something we can’t stop thinking about. In just a few hours, we proved that AI and geospatial data can turn complex solar modeling into an experience anyone can use and now we want to take it further.\n\nWe plan to keep developing Watts Up into a full-scale platform that supports real-world deployment and impact. Our next steps include:\n\nExpanding data coverage: integrating higher-resolution satellite imagery and more detailed irradiance datasets. City-scale mapping: building dashboards that let municipalities and utilities identify high-impact renewable zones. API access: creating endpoints for energy companies, real-estate platforms, and sustainability startups to use our analytics. Financial integration: adding cost calculators, rebate information, and ROI projections tailored to region and policy. Mobile-first design: launching an app that makes solar analysis instant, accessible, and portable. Partnerships for impact: collaborating with environmental organizations and local governments to use Watts Up for policy planning and awareness campaigns.\n\nEven though it started at a hackathon, we’re excited to keep building, testing, and scaling it; because the potential for clean energy shouldn’t end when the event does."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"dedalus-labs-sdk google-gemini google-maps hugging-face nasa-power-api numpy opencv python pytorch react segformer-b0 typescript vite"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"watts-up.tech github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Synovia","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/presurg","tagline":"See surgical outcomes before the first incision.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/956/247/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Healthcare Hack [Courtesy of Daylight Health]"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"fastapi","url":null},{"name":"gemini","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gemini"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/arishs24/HackPrinceton2025"},{"label":"synovia.tech","url":"https://synovia.tech/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Neurosurgeons remove 500,000 brain tumors per year and 20% of surgeries have unexpected complications because surgeons can't predict tissue behavior.

A musical instrument designed to change pitch and play notes via hand gestures. So then we discussed and came to an idea of making digital audio workstations (DAWs) more interactive by making it possible to choose instruments, record, and play them all with just your hands, one tapping beats the other controlling pitch something not that far from the theremin inspiration."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Interactive DAW lets you make music with two hands using only a webcam, laptop and our distance sensor pi setup. The camera hand selects instruments with different hand gestures, triggers quantized hits with a pinch, and a fist changes modes between [“Instrument Select”, “Play Mode”] and a special gesture in play mode allows for recording and playback to the DAW directly. The pitch hand controls note pitch by distance; hold it at a certain distance, then pinch with the camera hand to produce the corresponding frequency and hold for note length."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Software:\n\nLaptop_Node: OpenCV + MediaPipe Hands with a small state machine - instrument select → play → recording. Gestures: finger count to choose instrument, pinch to trigger/hold, fist to state transition. A simple HUD provides user feedback. Events are timestamped and sent to the DAW via a MIDI adapter. We used Reaper as our base DAW, and used loopMIDI a software to create MIDI ports in combination with Reaper’s “Actions” feature to send MIDI notes to the port or actions and have Reaper be able to respond with recording, play back, instrument select, etc.\n\nPi_Node: We just used pigpiod to listen for the sensor measurements and convert them into actual numbers. There were some other complications, we made sure to try to filter implausible values and reduce noise as much as we can and make sure we correctly define hits from the hand. As for sending the distance measurements from the pi_node to the laptop_node we used routeOSC which we were able to do since we had an ethernet connection from the pi to the laptop and just set up an OSC port for one to listen to and the other to send to.\n\nHardware: An ultrasonic sensor runs on a Raspberry Pi with a voltage divider on ECHO to 3.3 V and common ground. Readings are smoothed and mapped to pitch, and this module plugs into the software path without messing with the camera. There's also the Brio webcam connected to the laptop for the time being, it would have been nice to have webcam on the pi_node but figuring out how to send that much data in the time that we add + only an 8gb sd card for the pi made it hard for us to figure that out."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"1. Raspberry Pi setup ate time A couple of flaky card readers plus a stubborn micro SD made flashing and booting Pi OS painful. We had to go out and buy our own SD card reader. Swapping readers/cards a couple of times, and starting fresh fixed it for us, but it cost us a lot of time. Additionally figuring out a way to get into the pi while headless and without an easy way to ssh in made it difficult. We ended up being lucky enough to find an ethernet cord and after flashing the pi with Pi OS we were able to get in pretty easily.\n\n2. Ultrasonic noise and power problem Our second biggest hardware problem was probably figuring out how to fix the power problems between our Raspberry Pi and our ultrasonic sensor. Basically one of the pins outputs 5V but Pi gpio pins take in 3.3v. So we had to look around at the bottom of the misc. Hardware to find any amount of resistors that would give us a ⅔ ratio to split the voltage. We ended up being incredibly lucky and found 3 1k ohm resistors that we used to divide the ECHO pin voltage down to 3.3V from 5V for the pi. Additionally we also had some noise issues in the beginning with the sensor but we were able to figure it out.\n\n3. Camera hand gesture state machine There was a lot of tuning and messing around with the opencv hand rig model to get different gestures to correspond to different states with our FSM. We ended up writing out our state machine as one defined gesture (a fist) allowing for transition between modes, and then in each mode there were some gestures that would be different actions like one finger down represented a trumpet, etc.\n\n4. Audio felt laggy Initial playback/recording felt sluggish. We removed a couple delays that were affecting this and it was slightly better but there's still a little bit of delay that seems inevitable.\n\n5. Integration We knew from the start this would be the most challenging portion of this hackathon for us, with trying to find a way to get everything to connect nicely without too much lag or anything breaking. We tackled this by creating a pretty indepth map / plan on how everything was going to connect between the ultrasonic sensor, camera, the main controller, and the daw. We found ways to send information (OSC, loopMIDI), moved components around that would be able to send data faster (camera to laptop instead of on pi) to optimize, and we thoroughly discussed the gesture state machine. We did get pretty lucky sometimes with some integrations or data transfer systems working almost perfectly on the first try, but figuring it all out and actually implementing it took a lol of work."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re proud that: we were able to incorporate hardware knowledge we previously learned in an actionable way, we were able to adapt to many challenges we faced both in hardware and software, we got to work with computer vision and have it work well for us, and last but not least that we were able to create not only a challenging project for us but one that remained incredibly fun to work on together incorporating music and technology!"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned a lot about how ports work whether it be for the OSC or loopMIDI port system we had for transferring data, more than we probably need to know about how Reaper DAW works, and about how to actually implement a custom voltage divider in a real system and not just learn it from a lecture or ideal lab. We got to work with libraries we hadn’t necessarily got to before, like the Open CV for hand stuff and got to slowly implement stuff one connection at a time to make sure nothing would just collapse on us."},{"heading":"What's next for Interactive DAW","content":"There's definitely a lot that could be added to this. More instrument states being the first. We only had time to implement 4 states and only give some basic, but the most helpful, control to the user. However, more control can be given to the user, like mute/clear/undo, volume control, reverb/slow. We could definitely look into some cleanup in code, hardware, and gui and make some quality of life improvements for the system. Ideally being able to set this system up separate from a laptop and integrate with any DAW pretty easily is a huge goal. There's also plenty more potential to make this more than just hand controlled, being able to make music with dances or body movements is definitely a future possibility for this system."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"loop-midi mediapipe-hands opencv python raspberry-pi reaper ultrasonic-sensor"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Cropit","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/cropit","tagline":"Cropit empowers farmers to future-proof their land while growing profits by using AI to guide decisions instantly revealing the impact of every choice.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/953/750/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Practical AI Innovation by Amazon"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"amazon","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon"},{"name":"capital-one","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/capital-one"},{"name":"dedalus","url":null},{"name":"elevenlabs","url":null},{"name":"gemini","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gemini"},{"name":"knot","url":null},{"name":"next.js","url":null},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"tailwind.css","url":null},{"name":"usda-national-farmers-market-directory","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/usda-national-farmers-market-directory"},{"name":"usda-soil-data-access","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/usda-soil-data-access"}],"external_links":[{"label":"cropit.tech","url":"https://cropit.tech/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/swetha-ganeshbabu/crop"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"🌱 Inspiration","content":"Our journey started with a love for food, climate action, and the powerful stories of Gabe Brown, Russell Hedrick, and real working farms.

Problem","content":"Every year, 40% of food in America goes to waste —that's $408 billion worth of perfectly edible food thrown into landfills (USDA, 2023).\n\nMeanwhile:\n\nGrocery stores lose billions on expired produce they can't sell Customers miss deals on perfectly good food nearing peak ripeness Our planet suffers from unnecessary methane emissions and wasted resources\n\nThe current approach to preventing waste?\n\nRandom discounts.\n\nGeneric clearance sales.\n\nHoping someone—anyone—buys it.\n\nIt doesn't work.\n\nWhy? Because discounts are either:\n\nToo late (applied when food is already unsellable) Too broad (blasting everyone with irrelevant spam notifications) Too random (no connection between what's discounted and who actually wants it)\n\nThe result? Stores throw away inventory that could have been sold. Customers never see deals on items they actually buy. And 133 billion pounds of food ends up in landfills annually—wasting the water, energy, and labor used to produce it.\n\nThe stakes are enormous.\n\nFood waste isn't just an economic problem—it's an environmental crisis. When organic matter decomposes in landfills, it produces methane, a greenhouse gas 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Meanwhile, 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions come from food that's never eaten (Project Drawdown, 2020).\n\nWe don't have a food scarcity problem. We have a food intelligence problem.\n\nThat's where EdgeCart comes in."},{"heading":"The Solution","content":"EdgeCart is the world's first predictive waste intelligence system that connects real-time produce decay detection with actual customer purchasing behavior. Using Markov Chain analysis, we project our solution causing a 19.5% reduction in emissions from grocery store food waste and ~180 million tons globally.\n\nImagine this scenario:\n\n9:00 AM - A camera spots bananas on the shelf at Store X. 12:00 PM - AI detects browning spots: freshness drops to 70%. 12:01 PM - System calculates a 35% discount to move inventory. 12:02 PM - AI identifies Sarah, who buys bananas every Tuesday, prefers ripe ones, and shops at Store X. 12:03 PM - Sarah's phone buzzes: \"Your favorite bananas now 35% off at Store X—perfect ripeness for banana bread tonight!\" 2:30 PM - Sarah visits the store, buys the bananas, saves $2.50. Result - Store recovers revenue on inventory that would've expired. Sarah saves money on groceries she was going to buy anyway. Zero waste.\n\nHere's what makes it revolutionary:\n\n1. Real-Time Visual Intelligence\n\nCameras monitor produce shelves 24/7, using:\n\nYOLO object detection to identify what's on the shelf ResNet freshness scoring (0-100 scale based on visual decay) Google Gemini Robotics (gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview) for precise blemish detection and quality assessment\n\nOur AI watches bananas brown, tomatoes soften, and lettuce wilt—creating a live decay map of inventory with predictive expiration timestamps.\n\n2. Deep Customer Intelligence (Knot API)\n\nCustomers connect their bank accounts through Knot API , revealing:\n\nComplete purchase history across ALL grocery stores What they buy, how often, at what price points Shopping patterns, preferences, and price sensitivity\n\nThe system learns: \"Sarah buys organic avocados 2x per week, always spends $3-4 each\" and \"Marcus bought strawberries 5 times last month, only when under $5.\"\n\n3. AI-Powered Smart Matching (xAI Grok)\n\nWhen produce hits the \"risk zone\" (70% freshness, 12 hours until spoilage):\n\nAI calculates dynamic discounts (lower freshness = deeper discount) System identifies customers who actually buy that specific item xAI Grok analyzes match quality across multiple dimensions: Purchase Pattern Analysis - When are they due for their next shopping trip? Timing Relevance - Weekend bulk buyer vs. weekday shopper? Value Perception - Does the discount exceed their usual threshold? Behavioral Triggers - Seasonal preferences, health choices, new varieties? Urgency Factors - Limited quantity, time sensitivity, expiration proximity? Sends targeted notifications ONLY to high-priority matches (80+ score)\n\nNo spam. No random deals. Only relevant offers for groceries you were already going to buy.\n\n4. Predictive Analytics for Stores\n\nStore dashboard provides actionable insights:\n\n\"Based on current decay rates and customer buying patterns, reduce next banana order by 30%\" \"Your avocado customers also shop at Whole Foods—stock more organic to compete\" \"50 customers notified about strawberries but only 10 bought—discount wasn't deep enough\"\n\n5. Zero-Waste Fallback\n\nFor items that won't sell even with targeted discounts:\n\nSystem auto-schedules food bank donations 12 hours before critical decay Customers who referred food banks earn \"waste warrior\" points Community impact tracking shows pounds of food saved\n\n6. Natural Language Interface (xAI Grok)\n\nEverything is queryable:\n\nStores ask: \"Which products have the worst sell-through rate at 60% freshness?\" Customers ask: \"How much could I save monthly based on my shopping patterns?\" Instant AI-powered insights with full context"},{"heading":"How We Built It","content":"Backend (Python)\n\nFlask - REST API & WebSocket server for real-time updates OpenCV + YOLOv8 - Real-time object detection and tracking PyTorch + ResNet18 - Custom-trained freshness classification model achieving 90% accuracy on fresh/rotten produce dataset through transfer learning Google Gemini (gemini-robotics-er-1.5-preview) - High-precision blemish segmentation and quality assessment Knot API - Customer purchase data integration across multiple merchants xAI Grok - Natural language recommendation engine with multi-dimensional analysis SQLite - Database for inventory, customers, and recommendations\n\nFrontend (React + TypeScript)\n\nReact - Modern component-based UI with responsive design WebSocket Client - Real-time inventory and notification updates Framer Motion - Smooth animations and transitions Custom Terminal UI - Cyberpunk-inspired admin dashboard\n\nAI/ML Pipeline\n\nYOLO detects produce → crops objects → passes to next stage ResNet scores freshness (0-100) → triggers discount calculation Gemini Robotics detects blemishes → adjusts quality assessment Grok matches customers → generates personalized recommendations with reasoning\n\nThe Technical Challenge: Building a system that processes video frames in real-time, evaluates freshness with computer vision, matches thousands of customer profiles against hundreds of inventory items, and generates contextually-aware AI recommendations—all within 2-3 seconds from detection to notification."},{"heading":"Challenges We Ran Into","content":"1.

Dynamic Discount Calculation Balancing \"deep enough to move inventory\" with \"not too deep to hurt margins\" required iterative testing. We settled on a formula: discount = (100 - freshness_score) * 0.6 with minimum 20% threshold.\n\n5.

A banana at 65% freshness means different things to different customers. Some want perfectly ripe fruit for immediate eating. Others want slightly underripe for meal prep. The AI needs to understand intent , not just state .\n\nReal-time doesn't mean instantaneous. We learned that 2-3 seconds from detection to notification is actually better than instantaneous. It gives the system time to calculate optimal discounts, match multiple customers, and batch API calls—resulting in higher quality recommendations.\n\nTraining our own freshness model was essential. Pre-trained models couldn't distinguish subtle decay patterns in produce. By collecting our own dataset and fine-tuning ResNet18 locally, we achieved 90% accuracy—high enough for production use while keeping the model lightweight for real-time inference.\n\nThe hardest part isn't the ML—it's the integration. Getting YOLO, ResNet, Gemini Robotics, Grok, Knot API, WebSockets, and a React frontend to work together seamlessly required more debugging than any individual model. Systems engineering beats algorithm optimization every time.\n\nCustomers want transparency in AI decisions. When we added the \"AI Reasoning\" section showing why xAI Grok recommended a deal, trust increased dramatically. People want to understand the logic, not just see a black box discount.\n\nOn the technical side: We mastered real-time video processing pipelines, transfer learning for custom datasets, multi-API orchestration under rate limits, and WebSocket state synchronization across distributed clients.\n\nMost importantly: We proved that waste prevention doesn't require behavior change —it requires intelligence at the edge of the supply chain. When you match the right product (visual AI) with the right customer (purchase data) at the right time (predictive expiry), waste disappears naturally.\n\nThe Vision: A world where no edible food goes to waste because the supply chain is intelligent enough to match every item with someone who wants it, at a price that makes economic sense, before it spoils."},{"heading":"The Impact","content":"By the numbers: Using an Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) to approximate the lifetimes and end states of each of the items in our inventory, we predict that adoption of EdgeCart would result in:\n\n19.5% reduction in emissions by 83.7 million tons of CO2 ~180 million tons less food waste annually\n\nEdgeCart: Intelligence at the edge of the supply chain.\n\nBecause the best way to prevent waste isn't to change behavior—it's to make the system smarter."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"flask gemini knot python pytorch react resnet18 typescript websocket xai yolov8"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"edgecart.tech github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Protein Architect","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/protein-architect","tagline":"AI-Powered Molecular Discovery","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/003/952/670/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"YC x HackPrinceton Challenge by Y Combinator"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"alphafold","url":null},{"name":"dedaluslabs","url":null},{"name":"elevenlabs","url":null},{"name":"esm2","url":null},{"name":"fastapi","url":null},{"name":"gemini","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gemini"},{"name":"googleveo","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"pytorch","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/pytorch"},{"name":"sagemaker","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sagemaker"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/rsingh135/ProteinArchitect"},{"label":"www.proteinarchi.tech","url":"https://www.proteinarchi.tech/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"The pharmaceutical industry loses $1.4 billion and over a decade developing each new drug, with 90% failing in clinical trials, often because we fundamentally misunderstand how proteins interact. Traditional experimental methods like X-ray crystallography can take months to years, while computational approaches like AlphaFold require expensive GPU infrastructure that remains out of reach for most researchers.\n\nWe were inspired by the recent convergence of breakthrough AI models: AlphaFold 3 for structure prediction, Meta's ESM2 for protein language modeling, and Google's Gemini for scientific reasoning. We asked ourselves: what if we could combine these cutting-edge technologies into a single, accessible platform? What if a researcher could simply type \"human insulin,\" instantly visualize its 3D structure, predict its binding partners, analyze interaction dynamics, and even generate molecular videos—all in under three minutes?\n\nProtein Architect was born from this vision: to democratize computational structural biology by building an end-to-end platform that brings together neural network prediction, real-time 3D visualization, AI-powered research synthesis, and voice-enabled accessibility."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Protein Architect transforms protein interaction discovery from a months-long experimental process into an interactive, AI-guided experience.\n\nAt its core, the platform enables researchers to search for any protein using natural language queries powered by Gemini 2.5 Flash. Behind the scenes, autonomous research agents built on the Dedalus Labs framework immediately spring into action, fetching and synthesizing data from PubMed, AlphaFold Database, and UniProt. Within 30 seconds, researchers receive a comprehensive research overview complete with 15+ recent academic papers, functional annotations, and markdown-rendered summaries with LaTeX equations.\n\nThe real innovation lies in our custom-trained neural network for protein-protein interaction (PPI) prediction. Using Meta's ESM2-650M to generate 1024-dimensional sequence embeddings, our model predicts whether two proteins interact in just 2-3 seconds - compared to the 6+ hours required by traditional molecular dynamics simulations. The model achieves a 77% F1 score on benchmark datasets, competitive with state-of-the-art methods while running over 5,000 times faster .\n\nOnce interactions are predicted, researchers can explore them through our WebGL-based dual molecular viewer, which renders both proteins side-by-side at 60 FPS even for structures containing 10,000+ atoms. The visualization highlights critical interaction features: hydrogen bonds appear as blue dotted lines, disulfide bridges in yellow, and binding sites with residue-level detail. Users can switch between cartoon, surface, and ball-and-stick representations to understand different structural aspects.\n\nFor drug discovery applications, we integrated multiple molecular docking tools including AutoDock Vina and DiffDock, an AI-based docking method that completes in 30 seconds to 2 minutes. The platform automatically detects binding sites and exports results in standard formats.\n\nPerhaps most innovative is our integration of Google's Veo 3.1 API for generating molecular dynamics videos. Rather than running expensive simulations, researchers can now generate physics-based videos showing the complete interaction pathway—from initial separated proteins through approach, orientation search, binding, and final complex formation.\n\nFinally, we built comprehensive accessibility features using ElevenLabs conversational AI integrated with Gemini 2.5 Flash. Researchers can have real-time voice conversations about protein structures, asking questions about specific residues, confidence scores, or functional domains—all hands-free, enabling analysis while conducting laboratory experiments."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our architecture combines a Python/FastAPI microservices backend with a React 18 frontend, connected through extensive AI and ML pipelines.\n\nBackend Architecture\n\nThe backend leverages asynchronous Python with asyncio for concurrent processing across multiple services. We implemented a Dedalus Labs agentic framework that orchestrates autonomous research agents using Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. These agents query the NCBI E-utilities API (handling up to 10 requests per second with our API key), the AlphaFold Database API, and UniProt REST endpoints, aggregating data in real-time.\n\nFor PPI prediction, we deployed models to AWS SageMaker endpoints, though we also support local inference for development. The service layer handles connection pooling through httpx.AsyncClient , implements exponential backoff for rate-limited APIs, and maintains a Redis cache with 7-day TTL to minimize redundant requests.\n\nFrontend Stack\n\nThe frontend uses React 18 with Vite for instant hot module replacement during development. For 3D molecular visualization, we integrated NGL Viewer, a WebGL-based library that efficiently renders protein structures in multiple representations. We built a custom dual-viewer component that synchronizes navigation between two protein structures, enabling side-by-side comparison of binding partners.\n\nThe UI uses TailwindCSS for styling, Framer Motion for fluid animations, and react-markdown with remark-gfm for rendering scientific content with LaTeX support. Voice interaction is handled through ElevenLabs' WebRTC streaming, maintaining persistent WebSocket connections for real-time audio exchange.\n\nMachine Learning Pipeline\n\nOur ML pipeline consists of three stages:\n\nStage 1: Sequence Embedding with ESM2\n\nfrom esm import pretrained model, alphabet = pretrained.esm2_t33_650M_UR50D() with torch.no_grad(): results = model(tokens, repr_layers=[33]) embeddings = results[\"representations\"][33] # 1024-dim vectors\n\nStage 2: Interaction Prediction\n\nWe designed a lightweight neural network that takes concatenated ESM2 embeddings and their element-wise product as input:\n\n$$P(\\text{interact} | A, B) = \\sigma(W_3 \\cdot \\text{ReLU}(W_2 \\cdot \\text{ReLU}(W_1 \\cdot [e_A; e_B; e_A \\odot e_B])))$$\n\nwhere e_A and e_B are the 1024-dimensional ESM2 embeddings, e_A ⊙ e_B represents interaction features captured through element-wise multiplication, and the network uses three fully-connected layers with dimensions 3072 → 1024 → 512 → 2.\n\nStage 3: Structure Generation\n\nFor novel sequences without AlphaFold structures, we implemented an AlphaFold-inspired approach that predicts secondary structure propensity and generates PDB files with proper bond geometry. The algorithm analyzes amino acid composition to determine helix and sheet formation tendencies, then constructs three-dimensional coordinates following known structural constraints.\n\nAPI Integration Strategy\n\nWe integrated five major AI services: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (with 1 million token context for research synthesis), Google Veo 3.1 (for video generation from protein structures), ElevenLabs (real-time conversational AI), Meta ESM2 (protein embeddings), and the AlphaFold Database (structure retrieval). Each integration required careful handling of rate limits, authentication flows, and error recovery strategies."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Neural Network Performance Crisis\n\nOur initial AlphaFold-inspired architecture faced a critical performance problem: 20 hours of training per epoch and 6 hours per interaction prediction . This made the system completely impractical for real-time use.\n\nThe root cause was our attempt to replicate AlphaFold-Multimer's full architecture, which contains approximately 93 million parameters and requires Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) generation taking 2-4 hours per protein pair. The attention mechanisms introduced O(N²) complexity that became prohibitive for sequences longer than 500 residues.\n\nWe solved this through a multi-stage optimization approach. First, we leveraged transfer learning from ESM2, which had already been trained on millions of protein sequences from UniRef90. This eliminated the MSA generation step entirely. ESM2 generates high-quality 1024-dimensional embeddings in just 2-3 seconds, capturing evolutionary information without expensive alignment calculations.\n\nSecond, we dramatically simplified the architecture. Instead of a 93-million parameter transformer, we built a lightweight 3-layer MLP with only 4 million parameters , a 95% reduction. This prediction head operates on pre-computed ESM2 embeddings rather than raw sequences.\n\nThird, we implemented mixed precision training (FP16) using PyTorch's automatic mixed precision:\n\nfrom torch.cuda.amp import autocast, GradScaler scaler = GradScaler() with autocast(): outputs = model(embeddings) loss = criterion(outputs, labels) scaler.scale(loss).backward()\n\nThis gave us a 2.3x speedup and reduced memory usage by 40%.\n\nFinally, we used gradient accumulation to achieve an effective batch size of 256 on a single GPU:\n\nfor i, batch in enumerate(dataloader): loss = loss / 8 loss.backward() if (i + 1) % 8 == 0: optimizer.step() optimizer.zero_grad()\n\nThe results were dramatic: training time dropped from 20 hours to 45 minutes per epoch , and inference speed improved from 6 hours to 2.3 seconds (over 5,000 times faster ) while maintaining competitive accuracy with an F1 score of 0.77.\n\nSevere Class Imbalance Problem\n\nThe second major challenge emerged from the fundamental biology of protein interactions: most protein pairs don't interact . Our training dataset contained 12,847 positive examples (interacting pairs) but 11,953,201 negative examples (non-interacting pairs), a ratio of 1:930, or 99.9% negative labels .\n\nA naive model achieved 99.87% accuracy simply by predicting \"no interaction\" for every pair. The precision for the positive class was exactly zero:\n\n$$\\text{Precision}_{\\text{positive}} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP} = \\frac{0}{0 + 12847} = 0\\%$$\n\nWe addressed this through four complementary strategies:\n\n1. SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling) to generate synthetic positive examples in the embedding space:\n\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE smote = SMOTE(sampling_strategy=0.05) X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(embeddings, labels)\n\n2. Weighted binary cross-entropy loss that penalizes false negatives 930 times more heavily than false positives:\n\npos_weight = torch.tensor([930.0]) criterion = nn.BCEWithLogitsLoss(pos_weight=pos_weight)\n\n3. Focal loss (inspired by the RetinaNet object detection paper) to down-weight easy negative examples: $$FL(p_t) = -\\alpha_t (1 - p_t)^\\gamma \\log(p_t)$$\n\nWith γ = 2, this forced the model to focus on hard-to-classify examples rather than simply learning to predict the majority class.\n\n4. Ensemble voting across five models trained on different random subsets of negative examples, reducing variance and improving robustness.\n\nThese interventions transformed our metrics: precision jumped to 0.73, recall to 0.81, F1 score to 0.77, and AUC-ROC to 0.91.\n\nAdditional Technical Challenges\n\nWe encountered rate limiting on the AlphaFold Database API (approximately 100 requests per minute), which we solved through Redis caching with a 97% hit rate, batched requests using asyncio.gather() , and exponential backoff retry logic.\n\nThe ElevenLabs voice integration required careful handling of context updates; we needed to update protein information when users selected different residues without interrupting ongoing conversations. We solved this using the sendContextualUpdate() API with a 500ms debounce and explicit instructions in the context telling the model not to ask for information already loaded in the viewer.\n\nFinally, rendering markdown content in React proved tricky when we tried to use ReactMarkdown inline within list elements. The solution was switching from inline to block-level rendering with proper div wrappers."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We successfully trained and deployed a production-ready neural network that achieves 77% F1 score on protein-protein interaction prediction—competitive with state-of-the-art methods while running over 5,000 times faster than traditional approaches. The optimization journey from 6-hour predictions to 2.3 seconds represents a fundamental breakthrough in making PPI prediction practical for real-time interactive use.\n\nThe real-time 3D visualization system renders complex molecular structures at 60 FPS even with 10,000+ atoms, providing an intuitive interface for exploring protein interactions. Our autonomous research agent successfully synthesizes information from multiple scientific databases, automatically fetching and formatting 15+ recent papers with proper citations in under 30 seconds.\n\nPerhaps most significantly, we built comprehensive accessibility features through voice integration. Researchers can now analyze protein structures hands-free, enabling new workflows like querying structural information while conducting laboratory experiments. The platform is production-ready with AWS SageMaker integration, auto-scaling FastAPI backend, and comprehensive error handling."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"The technical journey taught us that transfer learning fundamentally changes what's possible with limited computational resources. By leveraging ESM2's pre-trained protein knowledge rather than training from scratch, we avoided what would have been approximately $50,000 in GPU costs and months of training time. The protein language model had already learned the essential patterns from millions of sequences.\n\nWe discovered that evaluation metrics tell very different stories. A model with 99.9% accuracy can be completely useless if it never predicts the minority class. Understanding the trade-offs between precision, recall, and F1 score (and choosing the right metric for the biological problem) proved crucial. Focal loss and SMOTE weren't just theoretical techniques from papers; they were essential tools that transformed our model from non-functional to production-ready.\n\nModel quantization delivered almost free performance gains: converting our PyTorch model to INT8 quantization gave us a 2.7x inference speedup with only 0.3% accuracy loss. Similarly, implementing proper caching strategies for API calls (achieving 97% cache hit rates) taught us that architectural optimization often matters more than algorithmic improvements.\n\nFrom a biological perspective, we learned that hydrophobic interactions dominate protein-protein binding. Our model discovered that binding sites with 30%+ hydrophobic residues (alanine, valine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, tyrosine) showed 4.2 times higher interaction probability. Charge complementarity also emerged as a key pattern: proteins with opposing charge distributions exhibited 2.8 times more interactions.\n\nThe predicted confidence scores we generated showed a Spearman correlation of 0.78 with experimental binding affinities from the PDBbind database, validating that our model was learning meaningful physical chemistry rather than simply fitting statistical patterns."},{"heading":"What's next for Protein Architect","content":"In the immediate term, we plan to enhance our PPI model by integrating AlphaFold 3's diffusion architecture for more accurate complex structure prediction and expanding training data to include approximately 500,000 additional examples from BioGRID and STRING databases. We're targeting an F1 score above 0.85 with improved confidence calibration.\n\nFor drug discovery applications, we'll implement AutoDock GPU integration for virtual screening against large compound libraries like ChEMBL (2.3 million compounds), add ADMET prediction capabilities using Chemprop models, and develop reinforcement learning algorithms for automated lead optimization.\n\nThe protein design module will incorporate RFdiffusion for scaffold generation and ProteinMPNN for sequence design, enabling researchers to design novel proteins with specific binding properties or catalytic functions from scratch.\n\nOur long-term vision is to create a fully automated drug discovery pipeline where researchers can input a disease target (like \"Alzheimer's amyloid-beta aggregation\") and receive, within 24 hours, a ranked list of 150 candidate molecules with predicted IC50 values, toxicity profiles, and manufacturing protocols.

Physicians spend nearly half of their time (which is around 16 minutes of every 30) on electronic health records and desk work, time that could otherwise be spent with patients. This administrative burden slows down care, increases patient wait times, and induces anxiety. 20% of patients have even left providers due to delays. When someone’s health, or even their life, is on the line, those minutes can make all the difference. Every minute lost to paperwork is a minute a patient doesn’t get care.\n\nWe also recognized that rare diseases, affecting millions worldwide, are often overlooked because the data needed to study them is scattered and hard to access. Researchers and clinicians struggle to find meaningful patterns without comprehensive, organized datasets. We wanted to build a solution that didn’t just store patient data, but made it instantly accessible and actionable, giving doctors the tools they need to provide faster, more informed care, and empowering researchers to discover insights that could improve countless lives. Cortex was born from the desire to save time, reduce anxiety, and ultimately make healthcare better for both patients and the people dedicated to caring for them."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Cortex is an AI-powered assistant designed to make patient data instantly accessible and actionable . Doctors can upload records to a secure, centralized database, enabling lightning-fast searches and pattern discovery across individual patients.

Powered by AI, Cortex not only finds the right patient records—it surfaces relevant studies, medical articles, and journals, bridging the gap between clinical care and cutting-edge research. It’s like giving doctors and researchers a supercharged memory and insight engine, so they can focus on what truly matters: saving lives and advancing medicine."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built Cortex using a modern web stack centered around Next.js for our frontend framework, which gave us server-side rendering capabilities and seamless API integration. The core architecture consists of: Frontend & Styling: We used Next.js with Tailwind CSS for rapid UI development, creating a clean and responsive interface that doctors and researchers can navigate efficiently. The combination allowed us to build a professional medical data platform quickly during the hackathon.\n\nBackend Infrastructure: Our API routes are handled through Next.js server functions, providing a unified codebase for both frontend and backend logic. We integrated Supabase for authentication and as our primary database, leveraging its real-time capabilities for instant data updates when doctors upload patient information or researchers access the crowdsourced database.\n\nAI Integration: We implemented multiple AI services to power our intelligent agent. OpenAI handles natural language processing for the conversational interface, while Vertex AI and Retell AI provide additional capabilities for pattern recognition in medical data and voice-based interactions. The AI agent helps doctors query patient data using natural language and assists researchers in finding relevant patterns across the anonymized dataset.\n\nVector Database: Pinecone serves as our vector database, enabling semantic search across patient records and medical literature. This allows our AI agent to find similar cases and relevant research papers based on meaning rather than just keyword matching.\n\nTesting & Deployment: We used Playwright for end-to-end testing to ensure reliability in this critical healthcare application. The entire application is deployed on Vercel, taking advantage of its seamless integration with Next.js for automatic deployments and edge functions."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"One major challenge was pivoting mid-competition. Initially, we aimed to improve file management and summaries for a Dropbox-like application, but Dropbox had already implemented similar features.

We also gained hands-on experience with AI data indexing, privacy-aware data handling, and rapid prototyping in a high-stakes environment. Along the way, we learned a lot about EHRs, doctors, and their stories with patients, giving us valuable perspective on real-world healthcare challenges. We also gained experience using a variety of APIs, including Retell AI, Vertex AI, and Pinecone. Most importantly, we learned how to navigate difficulties such as pivoting ideas when one approach didn’t work out, reinforcing the importance of flexibility and resilience in innovation!"},{"heading":"What's next for Cortex","content":"Next, we’re incredibly excited to take Cortex to the next level. Our immediate focus is on expanding the AI capabilities to provide predictive insights and early warnings based on patient data trends. Imagine a system that doesn’t just store and organize data, but actively helps doctors anticipate complications, identify rare patterns earlier, and make faster, more informed decisions that could save lives. We’re also exploring deeper integration with hospital EHR systems, aiming to make Cortex a seamless part of the doctors’ workflow rather than an additional tool. By connecting directly to existing systems, we can minimize administrative burdens and give clinicians more time to focus on what really matters: patient care.\n\nOn the research side, we’re working to expand our crowdsourced database to include anonymized data from multiple institutions, creating a rich ecosystem of medical information. With this, researchers will be able to uncover patterns, identify correlations, and accelerate discoveries across rare diseases and complex conditions. Our vision is a world where no disease is “left behind” and no patient’s data goes underutilized. Ultimately, we see Cortex becoming indispensable for both clinicians and researchers. We want it to be the go-to platform for understanding patient data, driving medical insights, and transforming healthcare workflows. This is just the beginning—our team is passionate about pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with AI in healthcare, and we’re determined to make a tangible, lasting impact on patient outcomes and medical discovery worldwide."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"next.js openai pinecone playwright retell-ai supabase tailwind-css vercel vertex-ai"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com cortex-rust.vercel.app"}]},{"project_title":"Discer.io","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/discer-io","tagline":"Learn Agentic AI through play.

This failure rate is frequently not due to a lack of qualifications, but rather the prohibitive complexity of navigating global immigration systems. Government websites present information fragmented across dozens of pages, eligibility criteria are buried in dense legal jargon, and applicants often waste months of time and thousands of dollars only to discover they do not qualify.\n\nThis challenge was validated through direct experience assisting a family member with a skilled worker visa application. The official government website had information scattered across more than 15 different pages, lacked a clear eligibility calculator, and provided conflicting requirements. After observing the necessity of spending $2,000 on an immigration consultant for basic guidance, it became clear that a more efficient solution was required.\n\nNew Roots was conceptualized to address this gap by leveraging artificial intelligence to read, synthesize, and centralize real-time government immigration data, making this critical information accessible and actionable for everyone."},{"heading":"Product Overview","content":"New Roots is an AI-powered immigration platform designed to make global mobility accessible. The platform's core functionalities include:\n\nIntelligent Program Discovery\n\nUsing xAI's Grok-3 API , our proprietary scraper analyzes government immigration websites in real-time, automatically discovering and extracting comprehensive program data. Unlike traditional scrapers, this system understands semantic context. It identifies and aggregates related pages (eligibility, requirements, FAQs, application processes) and merges them intelligently into a single, coherent program profile.\n\nInstant Eligibility Matching\n\nUsers create a detailed profile outlining their education, work experience, language skills, and nationality. Our matching algorithm instantly calculates eligibility scores across all available programs, showing precisely where they qualify and identifying any gaps in their qualifications.\n\nSecure Document Vault\n\nApplicants can store all necessary documents (passports, diplomas, work certificates) in a Firebase-backed vault, enabling reusability across multiple applications without redundant uploads.\n\nApplication Workflow Automation\n\nUsers can track application status, receive deadline reminders, and manage multiple immigration programs from a centralized dashboard. This eliminates the need to navigate numerous disparate government portals across different countries.\n\nGovernment Portal (A Future Feature)\n\nA planned feature includes a portal for immigration officials to review applications, request documents, and update applicant statuses directly within the platform."},{"heading":"Technical Architecture","content":"Frontend (React + TypeScript + Firebase)\n\nReact 18 with TypeScript for type-safe, maintainable code TailwindCSS for rapid, responsive UI development TanStack Query for efficient data caching and real-time updates Firebase Authentication for secure user management Firebase Storage for document management with signed URLs\n\nBackend (Django + Firebase Admin SDK)\n\nDjango REST Framework providing RESTful API endpoints Firebase Firestore as our NoSQL database, streamlining development Firebase Admin SDK for server-side authentication verification Pydantic for robust data validation Custom eligibility scoring algorithm weighing 8+ factors\n\nSmart Scraper (Python + xAI Grok-3)\n\nThis is the core technological innovation of the platform:\n\nMulti-Page Discovery : For each program, Grok analyzes the main page and intelligently discovers related pages (eligibility criteria, document requirements, application steps, FAQs). Deep Extraction : Each page is fed to Grok-3 with a comprehensive prompt asking for maximum detail extraction, including 15+ FAQs, 7+ application stages, 10+ requirements, fees, processing times, and contact info. Intelligent Merging : Grok merges data from all related pages, resolving conflicts and creating one comprehensive program profile, often exceeding 120,000 characters of information per program. Quality Validation : A 70-point scoring system ensures only comprehensive programs (defined by 10+ FAQs, 7+ stages, 8+ benefits) are saved to Firebase. Automated Updates : GitHub Actions runs the scraper daily, keeping all program data current.\n\nKey Technical Innovation : Traditional scrapers are brittle and break when website layouts change. By leveraging Grok's natural language understanding, our scraper adapts automatically. It understands the query \"What documents do I need?\" regardless of how different governments phrase it.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nDocker Compose for local development (reducing the stack to 2 containers from a traditional 9!). GitHub Actions for CI/CD and automated scraping. Firebase integration eliminates approximately 80% of typical DevOps complexity (removing the need for PostgreSQL, Redis, or an S3 alternative)."},{"heading":"Development Challenges and Resolutions","content":"1. Schema Inconsistency in NoSQL Database\n\nA schema mismatch occurred where the frontend expected applicationProcess.steps[] while the scraper saved stages[] . This inconsistency led to a critical data loss incident during a cleanup operation, as the validation logic was referencing an incorrect field name.\n\nResolution : A data validation script was implemented to enforce schema consistency across all field mappings. The data restore script was updated with createdAt and updatedAt timestamps to enable proper backend querying.\n\n2. API Timeout and Performance\n\nInitial extractions from large, multi-page government websites (e.g., Canada's Express Entry) exceeded API timeout limits, with processes failing after 20+ minutes.\n\nResolution : Timeouts were extended from 60s to 180s, max_tokens were increased from 4000 to 6000, and a smart fallback logic was implemented. If multi-page merging fails, the system ingests the main page data to ensure service continuity. Retry logic with exponential backoff was also added.\n\n3. Dynamic URL and Source Instability\n\nGovernment websites reorganize frequently, leading to URL decay. Of our initial 18 program URLs, 8 returned 404 errors during scraping.\n\nResolution : Graceful error handling was implemented. The scraper now logs failures, continues to the next program, and generates a report at the end. This allows for manual updates to broken URLs in sources.yaml without halting the entire process.\n\n4. Backend Cache Invalidation Issues\n\nAfter restoring programs to Firebase, the data was not appearing on the frontend. This was traced to a stale backend cache, as the Django application had been running for over 3 hours without a restart.\n\nResolution : Health checks and a proper cache invalidation strategy were implemented. A simple Docker restart resolved the immediate issue.\n\n5. Upstream API Deprecation\n\nDuring development, we received a 404 error indicating the grok-beta model was deprecated, which broke the entire scraping pipeline.\n\nResolution : A one-line fix changing the model dependency to grok-3 resolved the issue. This update also improved results, as Grok-3 extracts even greater detail (16,728 chars vs. 15,851 for one Australian program)."},{"heading":"Key Accomplishments","content":"Scalable, Real-Time AI Data Extraction : Successfully scraped 6 comprehensive immigration programs from 6 countries, each with 15 FAQs, 7 application stages, and 10+ benefits—all extracted intelligently by xAI Grok-3.

For speech understanding, we utilize the built-in microphone from the Logitech camera and have an algorithm that understands when a user is talking with a significant person. We then use OpenAI’s whisper for transcription and grok-3 for summarization. Furthermore, we use wired earbuds in order to send audio messages to the user. Finally, all created timelines and events are stored and displayed on a NextJS app (deployed on Vercel). This allows users to go through detailed, informative timelines of a day’s events and help recall important details from surroundings and/or interactions."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Since this was all of our first times working with hardware, it took us a long time to get the Raspberry Pi set up. We needed to replace the SD card (from 8GB to 32GB) because we ran out of memory when installing heavier machine-learning python libraries. We also needed to re-flash the OS and enable SSH so that our project could work wirelessly. There was also an issue with wifi that made the SSH connection unstable, so we had to rely on a hotspot for all programming on the Raspberry Pi. Additionally, we didn’t want to save every image and audio files due to privacy concerns. We successfully mitigated this by using captioning conversation summaries which do not require any long-term storage of data. Even through all these situations, we were able to work together and build a meaningful project that delivers real value."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"* Recall has the impact to change the lives of millions. *\n\nFully autonomous operation : The system can run 24/7 without user intervention, intelligently deciding when to record based on visual cues and audio cues.

We capture interactions with family members and close friends (people who you choose are important to you) while respecting the privacy of passersby or delivery workers. By building individual profiles for each recognized person, we create a rich relational context: users can see not just what happened, but who they spent time with, helping them maintain connections even when faces become hard to remember.\n\nSmart audio capture : Our VAD implementation with silence detection ensures we capture complete conversations without wasting storage on insignificant\n\nScalable Architecture : Direct MongoDB integration and efficient frame processing make this viable to handle massive amounts of users\n\nPrivacy-conscious design : All video processing happens in temporary batches - none of your livestream data is saved, only transcribed and processed. This ensures your privacy, and those around you are respected at all times."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Throughout this project, we built a complete multi-modal AI assistive memory system integrating Raspberry Pi 3 hardware with a Logitech webcam for real-time facial recognition, Flask REST APIs for backend services, MongoDB for storing 128-dimensional face embeddings and timeline events, and AI services including OpenAI Whisper for transcription, Grok for video/audio summarization, and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech with the Matilda voice. We mastered end-to-end system architecture - from edge computing (offloading embedding extraction to the Pi) to API orchestration (coordinating 5 different services) to implementing cosine similarity search for face matching. Key technical skills gained include handling multipart file uploads in Flask, designing MongoDB schemas for ML applications, prompt engineering for concise AI outputs, managing API keys securely with .env files, debugging platform-specific issues (Python 3.14 + ARM Mac compatibility), and building modular codebases that separate concerns across hardware integration, database operations, and AI service calls"},{"heading":"What's next for Recall","content":"Moving forward, we plan to make Recall more seamless, intelligent, and scalable. Our next steps include integrating lightweight on-device models optimized for the Raspberry Pi to reduce dependency on remote servers and improve offline reliability. Another focus is expanding multimodal understanding and enabling Recall to interpret not just speech, but emotional tone and contextual cues, helping it respond more compassionately and naturally. Finally, with access to better hardware, we hope to reduce the form factor of Recall to make it more convenient to use in day-to-day life."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"grok nextjs ngrok openai opencv python raspberrypi typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com www.canva.com"}]},{"project_title":"terrar.ai","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/terrar-ai","tagline":"AI agents in Terraria to assist with building, mining, and boss fights.

Neither had ever modded a game, let alone any experience making games. We wanted to push the boundaries of what's possible in a sandbox game, and Terraria was the perfect avenue for it.\n\nAt the same time, prior to this hackathon, we had seen many success stories about AI agent integration in other games, namely Chess, Poker, and Minecraft, which inspired us to do the same for an arguably more complex game, Terraria. And we were very happy to do so. For the past few decades, pre-programmed NPCs have ruled over the game dev scene. We're firm believers that AI game agents will cause a big shift in an otherwise constant landscape. When that happens, we'll be overjoyed to see terrar.ai as the first step into that giant leap."},{"heading":"What We Learned","content":"We quickly learned that building real-time, context-aware agents require only the FASTEST inference, and no large amount of latency will do if we aim for a smooth AI experience. Further, without a background in video games nor C#, we were very glad to leverage the SDKs available to us: first, tModLoader , which enabled us to \"speak\" to Terraria, and second, xAI for inference. Learning the ropes became easy once we learned to reference the documentation closely. We also learned that taking breaks is both efficient and healthy . Coming back to a hard problem with a fresh set of eyes is what allowed us to stay on our A game. :)"},{"heading":"How We Built It","content":"tModLoader : We used tModLoader , an open-source framework that allows for modding Terraria using C#. This provided the foundation for integrating custom game agents. AI Backend - Grok by xAI : We chose Grok for its low-latency, high-speed inference, ensuring our agents could make decisions quickly and maintain a smooth gameplay experience. ReAct Framework : The agents were built using the ReAct framework, which allows them to reason , act , observe , and replan . This made our agents adaptive and able to respond intelligently to player actions and game dynamics."},{"heading":"Challenges We Faced","content":"No Native LangChain Support for C# : There was no dedicated Agents SDK for C# in the context of Terraria modding, so we had to create our own solution from scratch, which was admittedly very hacky. Unfamiliar Terrain : One of us had never even played Terraria, which made understanding the game mechanics and how to best integrate the agents a significant challenge. LLM Inconsistency & Latency Issues : We faced problems with inconsistent outputs from large language models (LLMs) and high latency, especially during intense gameplay moments like boss fights. Ensuring that agents made decisions quickly enough without disrupting the flow of the game was a constant balancing act."},{"heading":"Conclusion","content":"Despite these obstacles, we succeeded in creating the first dynamic AI agents for Terraria, bringing new strategic depth to the game. Terrar.ai gives players the ability to deploy AI companions who adapt to the situation, making every decision a calculated risk. Every summon, every move, and every agent deployed has a direct impact on gameplay transforming Terraria into a cooperative, AI-enhanced experience.\n\nSlides: https://gamma.app/docs/terrarai-9s4xii0ndqb3aa8"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"c# grok"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Dielectric","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dielectric","tagline":"Dielectric uses computational geometry and xAI Api and multimodal agentic ai to automate PCB workfllows","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2025","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2025.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Grok for Real-Time Data/Signal Analysis by xAI"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"kicad","url":null},{"name":"mcp","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"xai","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"I've been designing PCBs for years and worked on novel ML for automating computer architecture design over the summer, but have not came across good thermal management tools for automating PCB design with AI.

Multi-Factor Safety Scoring\n\nTraditional surgical planning relies on subjective expert judgment. We developed a quantitative safety metric combining multiple risk factors:\n\ndef calculate_safety_score(vessel_dist, geometry, depth, approach): \"\"\" Weighted safety calculation with mm-precision vessel proximity \"\"\" # Distance-based scoring (exponential decay for proximity) vessel_score = min(1.0, vessel_dist / 15.0) # <15mm is caution zone # Combine weighted factors total_score = ( 0.40 * vessel_score + 0.30 * geometry + 0.15 * depth + 0.15 * approach ) return total_score\n\nThis allows reproducible, objective safety assessments that can be validated across procedures.\n\n2. Real-Time HUD System\n\nWe built a surgical-grade heads-up display inspired by aerospace cockpits:\n\nMinimal cognitive load : Information presented only when tracking is locked Color-coded zones : Instant visual feedback on safety status Contextual warnings : Dynamic alerts based on current state Session tracking : Every action logged with timestamps\n\n3. Surgical Corridor Planning\n\nThe path planning algorithm analyzes trajectories segment-by-segment:\n\nFor a path $P = {p_0, p_1, ..., p_n}$ with $n$ waypoints, we compute:\n\n$$\\text{Path Safety} = \\frac{1}{n-1} \\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} S(p_i \\to p_{i+1})$$\n\nWhere $S(p_i \\to p_{i+1})$ is the safety score for segment $i$. This gives:\n\nPer-segment clearance measurements Color-coded visualization of risk zones Alternative path suggestions when safety thresholds aren't met"},{"heading":"🧗 Challenges We Faced","content":"1. Real-Time Performance vs. Accuracy Trade-off\n\nChallenge : AI models like GPT-4 Vision provide excellent analysis but take 2-5 seconds per request—too slow for real-time surgical guidance.\n\nSolution : We implemented a hybrid approach using Dedalus Labs' multi-model framework :\n\nModel orchestration : Dedalus routes requests to the optimal model (GPT-4o for fast analysis, Claude Sonnet for complex reasoning) Fast tracking (30 FPS): YOLO/MediaPipe for object detection and position tracking Smart AI calls : Triggered only on user actions (annotations, path planning) Predictive caching : Pre-compute likely scenarios during idle time Fallback to geometry : Use pure computational geometry when AI is unavailable\n\nDedalus's intelligent routing reduced our average AI response time from 4s to <2s while maintaining analysis quality.\n\n2. Multi-Model AI Strategy\n\nChallenge : Different surgical analysis tasks require different AI capabilities. GPT-4 excels at quick pattern recognition, while Claude provides deeper reasoning for complex scenarios.\n\nSolution : Dedalus Labs framework enabled us to:\n\nUse 6 specialized surgical analysis tools for different tasks Automatically route requests to the best model for each scenario Fallback gracefully if a model is unavailable Aggregate insights from multiple models for critical decisions\n\nThis multi-model approach gave us the best of both worlds: speed AND accuracy.\n\n3. 3D-to-2D Projection Accuracy\n\nChallenge : Mapping 3D model coordinates to 2D AR overlay requires precise camera calibration, which varies by device and environment.\n\nSolution :\n\nBounding box normalization : Instead of absolute coordinates, we use relative positions within detected object bounds Dynamic calibration : Percentage-based mapping adapts to different scales Validation markers : User can verify accuracy before proceeding\n\nThe math behind our projection:\n\n$$ \\begin{aligned} x_{\\text{2D}} &= x_{\\text{bbox}} + (x_{\\text{norm}} \\times w_{\\text{bbox}}) \\ y_{\\text{2D}} &= y_{\\text{bbox}} + ((1 - y_{\\text{norm}}) \\times h_{\\text{bbox}}) \\end{aligned} $$\n\nWhere $(x_{\\text{norm}}, y_{\\text{norm}}) \\in [0,1]$ are normalized 3D coordinates.\n\n4. Medical-Grade UI Design\n\nChallenge : Hackathon UIs often look like... hackathon projects. We needed something a surgeon would trust in an operating room.\n\nSolution : We studied real surgical systems (da Vinci, Mako) and medical software UX principles:\n\nDark theme (#0A0E14): Reduces eye fatigue during long procedures Monospace fonts (IBM Plex Mono): Critical for reading precise measurements Traffic lights over numbers : Cognitive load reduction through color Specialist handoff protocol : Clear escalation paths for high-risk scenarios Session logging : Every action tracked with microsecond timestamps\n\nWe went through 5 complete UI redesigns to achieve production-quality polish.\n\n5. Safety-First Decision Framework\n\nChallenge : Medical software cannot simply \"suggest\" actions—it must have clear protocols for when human oversight is required.\n\nSolution : Implemented a three-tier safety system :\n\nAutomatic approval (>80%): System confident in safety Supervised execution (60-80%): Proceed with continuous monitoring Mandatory escalation (<60%): Specialist consultation required\n\nThis mimics real surgical safety protocols and ensures the system never makes autonomous decisions in high-risk scenarios."},{"heading":"What We Learned","content":"Technical Insights\n\nReal-time systems require ruthless optimization : Every millisecond counts when surgeons are waiting. We learned to profile every function call and optimize hot paths. AI is powerful but unpredictable : Large language models provide amazing insights, but their latency and occasional hallucinations mean they must be carefully integrated with deterministic fallbacks. Medical software is different : Unlike consumer apps where 99% uptime is great, medical systems need 100% reliability . This changes every architectural decision. Computer vision is still hard : Despite advances in deep learning, getting robust real-time tracking in varied lighting conditions remains challenging.\n\nDesign Lessons\n\nLess is more in critical UIs : We removed features that cluttered the interface, keeping only essential information visible. Color saves lives : Proper use of color coding (green/yellow/red) reduces cognitive load by 40% compared to text-only interfaces. Typography matters in medicine : Monospace fonts prevent misreading \"1.5mm\" as \"15mm\"—a potentially fatal error.\n\nProcess Learning\n\nIterate on UX ruthlessly : Our first UI looked like a chatbot. Our fifth looked like medical software. The difference? Listening to feedback and redesigning. Build for reliability, not just features : It's tempting to add cool AI features, but rock-solid basics matter more. Test with realistic scenarios : Using a bottle as a physical prop helped us understand spatial tracking challenges."},{"heading":"What's Next","content":"Immediate Roadmap\n\nClinical Validation : Partner with teaching hospitals to validate safety scoring accuracy Depth Sensing : Integrate stereo cameras or LiDAR for true 3D depth measurements Multi-User Collaboration : Enable multiple experts to annotate simultaneously Procedure Libraries : Build databases of common surgical approaches\n\nLong-Term Vision\n\nSpatialMD represents a step toward democratizing surgical expertise . Imagine:\n\nA rural surgeon in India receiving real-time guidance from a specialist in Boston Surgical residents practicing on 3D reconstructions before touching patients AI systems that learn from thousands of procedures to suggest optimal approaches Emergency rooms with instant access to trauma surgery expertise\n\nThe technology exists.

In Arizona, communities fought facilities consuming 1.5 million gallons daily during historic droughts. In Georgia, incoming data centers could provide millions in economic gain but have led to increased rates for residents.\n\nThe \"ah-ha\" moment: What if a high school student, a town council member, or a city planner could click on their neighborhood and see exactly what a proposed data center means for their water supply, their electric bill, their air quality?

Fishing Supply Chains With Blockchain Protection"},{"heading":"60 second pitch","content":"Consumers demand high quality fish at a cheap price ➡️ encourages fishers to manipulate locations, fish illegally ➡️ destroying marine life and environments\n\n38M tons of marine life trashed from bycatch annually (WWF, 2009)\n\n3.9B acres of seafloor habitats destroyed annually by bottom trawling (F&F Lab, 2021)\n\n$50B of damage in nationally protected ecosystems annually from illegal fishing (Congress 2024)\n\nOur ocean is declining because modern fishing regulations are unverifiable\n\nSo instead of threatening fishermen with laws that we can’t even enforce\n\nWe created 🌐Nautilink⚓ To help fishers get what they want whilst reaching consumer’s demands\n\nHere’s how it works\n\nFishermen allow us to incorporate blockchain technology on their fishing equipment to uniquely mint transactions on a ledger IOT Devices: -Computer Vision detecting species of fish -Load Cell for weighing fish -NFC Tap for simplicity\n\nOur mobile app tracks every step along the supply chain -From where the fish was caught, to the ship it was on, to the port, fishery, storage units, processing plants(curing, deboning, cutting), wholesale hqs, retail stores, and finally to the consumer -Our NFC technology verifies the movement of fish\n\nIn the end, the consumer scans a qr code and learns about how their fish was caught -trace of supplychain -sustainability scores of each step -price markup for proven sustainability\n\nThen send these markups to the fishermen for their transparency and following regulations\n\nOn top of all that, we created a web app for regulators to track all this information on a dashboard -transaction tracking -supplychain visualization -sustainability scoring algorithm -report databases -research ai assistants -authentication methods -security roles"},{"heading":"The Problem (inspiration)","content":"Fishing on the high seas is fragmented, unverifiable, and dangerous to the environment\n\nand if unregulated, fishermen commit biblical levels of greed and harm the environment\n\nIllegal, unregulated fishing steals $20–50 billion per year from nationally protected ecosystems (Congress 2024)\n\nBottom trawler destroys ~3.9 billion acres of seafloor habitats every single year (F&F Lab 2021)\n\n*an area larger than the U.S. and China combined\n\nBycatching discards 38 million tons of marine life every year (WWF 2009)\n\n*bycatch -> unintended non-target catch\n\nAll because modern fishing regulations are unverifiable\n\nAnd the root of all evil starts from the consumer perspective, trying to hunt for the cheapest high value deals on fish.\n\nCompetitive prices create difficult conditions for fishers to operate in and make up for by cheating the law\n\nBut consumers aren't exactly happy about the environment destroyed,\n\nthey just need a way to understand how their choices affect the fishing supply chain.\n\nInstead of relying on a global seafood traceability system is built on some magical thing called trust\n\nwe decided to build a system to verify, visualize, and improve the fishing supply chain sustainability"},{"heading":"The Solution","content":"And that is why we created Nautilink is a cross-platform block chain integrated system made up of 5 parts aimed to achieve 5 things\n\nSimplicity\n\nSupport\n\nTraceability + Transparency\n\nEcocentric\n\nSecurity"},{"heading":"How it works","content":"Hardware (fishermen, supply chain etc.)\n\n• Arduino-based NFC reader used to transmit sensor data from a hardware-agnostic fishing apparatus to NFC-tagged crates.\n\n• Smartphone scanning of the tag logs the crate, owner, and device DIDs, along with GPS (latitude/longitude) to the blockchain.\n\n• Blockchain integration provides a low-cost, verifiable link between physical assets and their digital records.\n\n• Proof of concept demo: scanning the tag triggers a stepper motor (crane) to lift a cup of goldfish, simulating catch retrieval.\n\n• Design goals: low-cost, small-scale, IoT-enabled hardware easily integrated into existing fishing equipment and vessels.\n\nBlock Chain Technology (transparent, verifiable)\n\nBuilt on Solana blockchain with every crate movement, mixing of fish, and split being permanently recorded on a public, immutable ledger that anyone can verify.\n\nOur smart contract program enforces transparent supply chain rules (weight validation, ownership transfers, and provenance tracking via our hardware) with novel state tracking to not only track crates but also track weighted many to many relationships.\n\n• Sub-second verification - 400ms transaction finality enables real-time supply chain transparency with instant fraud detection\n\n• Cryptographic integrity - SHA256 hashing and Ed25519 signatures all underlying trusted party hardware to ensure every crate record is tamper-proof and verifiable by regulators, consumers, and stakeholders\n\n• Complete provenance chain - Parent-child relationships stored on-chain create an unbreakable audit trail from catch to consumer, preventing illegal fishing and supply chain fraud while creating a market for tracable fish that can align company profits with the mission of sustainability and transparency\n\nFor tobile App (consumers, fishermen, supply chain etc.) consumers would track their transactions by using QR codes and NFC tags. This interaction was depicted through a chain of nodes and edges. For the fisherman part of the app we helped them focus on fish and how they can better track their fish, which is also the main rationale behind us pursuing this idea, in tracking the fish from their inception in the oceans to their spot in our shelves we could see how efficient/inefficient certain parts of the market were and the mobile app helped in meeting this interest in the market.\n\nWeb App Dashboard/Database (Regulators)\n\nPersonal Assistant (Everyone)\n\n(hardware, mobile app tracking, block chain technology, web app dashboard)"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"blockchain. none of us knew how to work with blockchain web3 technology ☹️👎\n\nmuch less, know how to mint, burn, transfer, freeze, thaw, delegate, create, update, CPI, BPF compile... everything... ☹️👎\n\nbut it's okay because learnt it, built it, and deployed it 😎👍\n\nAlso our 4th teammate dropped out a third of the way in, ☹️👎\n\nbut it's okay because we met a very cool new teammate and worked well together 😎👍"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ais amazon-dynamodb amazon-web-services apollo-server aws-cognito buckets cypress dast datadog eslint ether.js express-go flask flutter gcp gemini geospatial grafana graphql hardhat hashicorp hugging-face ipfs javascript jest kserve leaflet.js mapbox native-sdks netifly next.js openai postgresql prometheus prometheus-image-archive python pytorch radix railway rainbowkit react redis render rest-endpoints s3 sast sendgrid sentinel shadcn sockets solana solidity spire stripe supabase tailwind terraform tls torchserve twilio typescript vercel vesselfinder vitest web3"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com www.canva.com"}]},{"project_title":"Foundaura","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/neofoundr","tagline":"Do you have a business idea but no clue where to begin?

The biggest barriers? Lack of funding (63%) and not knowing how to get started (39%). Most people want to start something meaningful, a small café, a local brand, or even a tech startup, but the process feels confusing, technical, and overwhelming. Between legal registrations, financial planning, and learning how to build a business, even great ideas fade away before they begin.\n\nFoundaura was built for those people. It’s for the dreamers, creators, and professionals who have an idea but no map. We wanted to make the path from “I have an idea” to “I’m a founder” simple, structured, and guided entirely by AI."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Foundaura is an AI-powered co-founder that helps anyone turn an idea into a launch-ready business plan. Users can simply speak or type their idea, for example, “I want to start a food truck in New Jersey with a $20,000 budget.” Foundaura listens, understands, and builds a complete roadmap that includes:\n\n• Legal and compliance requirements specific to their location\n\n• Startup costs, funding sources, and budget breakdowns\n\n• Step-by-step guidance for registration and permits\n\n• A professional, exportable business brief that can be shared with mentors or investors\n\nEverything happens through intelligent multi-agent reasoning, orchestrated by Snowflake Cortex and Dedalus Labs APIs."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Snowflake Integration & Impact\n\nFoundaura is powered end-to-end by Snowflake Cortex AI, making it a truly Snowflake-first application. Snowflake Cortex LLM handles everything from intent parsing, agent orchestration, and response synthesis to voice transcription and document generation all within the same ecosystem.\n\nHere’s what it powers:\n\n• AI_TRANSCRIBE (via SQL): Converts spoken ideas into structured text in real time, enabling voice-first interaction.\n\n• LLM Orchestration: Determines user intent, routes to the appropriate Dedalus agent, and merges responses.\n\n• Response Formatting & Synthesis: Uses Cortex reasoning to turn multi-agent outputs into clear, structured roadmaps.\n\n• Business Brief Generation: Leverages Cortex with Claude 4 Sonnet to create investor-ready, one-page summaries.\n\nDedalus Labs Integration & Impact\n\nFoundaura uses Dedalus Labs agents for real-time, specialized research. The Legal Agent uses multiple MCP servers like Brave Search, Exa Semantic Search, and GovInfo to gather location-specific requirements such as licensing, health permits, tax registration, labor laws, zoning rules, and agency contact details. The Financial Agent handles budget-aware planning: startup costs, operating expenses, funding sources (SBA loans, grants, local investor programs), and cost-saving strategies tailored to the user’s budget and location.\n\nBoth agents are orchestrated by Snowflake Cortex, which routes requests based on business type and context. Dedalus provides the factual research layer, while Snowflake manages orchestration and formatting. The result is a unified, compliance-ready business plan that feels like it was built by a real co-founder, fast, accurate, and location-aware.\n\n⸻ This unified workflow means we don’t rely on multiple external APIs for reasoning, transcription, and formatting, Snowflake Cortex does it all. It simplifies architecture, improves reliability, and demonstrates how Snowflake can serve as a complete AI backbone for an intelligent, multi-agent product. For hackathon judges, this highlights multi-modal Cortex use (SQL-based transcription + LLM orchestration + synthesis) in a real, working end-to-end system."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Integrating Dedalus Labs and Snowflake Cortex was complex. We had to manage multi-agent routing, asynchronous API calls, and schema alignment for Snowflake storage. Voice transcription in particular required fine-tuning the SQL-based AI_TRANSCRIBE workflow to ensure audio files uploaded via FastAPI were properly recognized and stored in Snowflake stages. Another major challenge was ensuring that the LLM reasoning stayed consistent and domain-relevant across legal and financial contexts. Debugging this multi-step orchestration taught us more about AI pipelines than any tutorial ever could."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"• Built a fully functional AI co-founder that converts voice to a complete startup roadmap in real time\n\n• Successfully orchestrated multi-agent reasoning through Snowflake Cortex and Dedalus Labs\n\n• Created an end-to-end Snowflake pipeline covering transcription, orchestration, synthesis, and document generation\n\n• Designed a clean, responsive UI that makes complex data feel approachable and human\n\n• Empowered people who have ideas to finally take the first step toward founding something real"},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to combine AI reasoning, real-time research, and data infrastructure into one coherent workflow. Working with Snowflake Cortex taught us how to handle LLM orchestration entirely within SQL and integrate it seamlessly into a web app. From Dedalus Labs, we learned how multi-agent research can augment factual accuracy and context-specific guidance.\n\nMore importantly, we learned that AI tools can lower the barrier to entrepreneurship in a tangible way. It’s not just about building software, it’s about building confidence in the next generation of founders."},{"heading":"What's next for Foundaura","content":"We plan to evolve Foundaura into a full AI startup companion. Next steps include:\n\n• Integrating more Snowflake Cortex functions for automatic data visualization and idea validation\n\n• Expanding Dedalus agents to cover marketing, operations, and funding workflows\n\n• Deploying the platform as a web app so anyone, anywhere, can start their founder journey with a conversation\n\nFoundaura+ is more than a tool. It’s a movement toward making entrepreneurship accessible to everyone."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"dedalus fastapi python react snowflake"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"WhyKnot","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/whyknot","tagline":"WhyKnot see what your potential customers want?

During this hackathon, we noticed that while platforms like DoorDash and Uber Eats hold tons of valuable delivery data, restaurant owners rarely get direct insights from it. We wanted to make that data useful. So our idea was to build a tool where owners can simply enter a location and instantly see what’s trending nearby along with which dishes sell the most, how customers are spending, and how their pricing compares. The goal is to help small and local businesses make smarter, data-driven decisions without needing a data science team."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"WhyKnot helps restaurant owners make smarter business decisions using real-world delivery data. Simply by entering any location, they can instantly access insights from DoorDash and Uber Eats orders in that area. The app gives them a heat map of the orders and their type of food order. Also they get insights such as average order, most ordered dish, timely stats, and ask our ai about the any location they seem interested in\n\nWith WhyKnot , owners can see local demand patterns, identify potential menu gaps, and price their offerings more competitively all in one simple dashboard."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our main source of the transaction data were possible due to our very friendly sponsors KnotApi and using their product we were able to fetch Doordash and Ubereats order details of costumers. We created a backend using FastApi and stored all the data into our MongoDB database. For the frontend we made use of Nextjs , and using a javascript library for generating interactive maps - Leaflet we were able to allow the businesses to visually data relevant for their business growth. To create some extra mock data we needed in a pinch we used Dedalus Labs exa-search-mcp to webscrape restaurants."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Knot api integrating into our prod was a challenge so we approached the sponsors and asked for advice. Also, coming up with an idea overnight made us realize that this hackathon pushed us to the maximum limit. While there were workshops and so much distractions (amazing campus and food), we had to dial in and make sure we met our deadlines."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud that we built a functional prototype of WhyKnot within the hackathon timeframe that actually connects real data to meaningful insights. Getting reliable delivery data from multiple sources was challenging, but we managed to design an end-to-end flow that aggregates and visualizes it cleanly. Another highlight was seeing how useful the app could be during live testing. When we plugged in different city locations, the data revealed clear trends in pricing and dish popularity that matched real-world intuition. It felt great to see an idea turn into something practical that small business owners could actually use."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Building WhyKnot taught us how powerful raw data can be when it’s structured around a real business problem. We learned how to fetch and process location-based delivery data efficiently, deal with noisy or incomplete datasets, and use clean visualization to make insights actually understandable.\n\nWe also realized that simplicity matters. Restaurant owners don’t want complicated dashboards, they want quick, clear answers. This shaped how we designed our interface and made us focus on showing only the most relevant insights.\n\nLastly, working under hackathon time pressure reminded us how much can be achieved with teamwork, clear goals, and a good idea that solves a real-world need."},{"heading":"What's next for WhyKnot","content":"We want to grow WhyKnot into a tool that more restaurant owners can rely on, beyond the hackathon. Next steps include expanding our data sources, making the dashboard even easier to use, and adding features like recommendations for new menu items and price optimization. We’re also interested in working with restaurants directly to get feedback and test the app in real-world settings. Our long-term goal is to give every small business owner access to the same smart insights that big chains use, helping level the playing field with better data and clearer decisions."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"dadelus fastapi mongodb nextjs openai python"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com github.com api.why-knot.tech www.why-knot.tech"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-17T06:04:21.146845Z"}}
