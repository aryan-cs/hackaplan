While examining the abnormal patterns, it was observed that most seizure patterns had a small window that transitioned from a typical pattern to a seizure pattern around a 15-second window. Most of the accidents and damage in seizures are caused by falling, lack of help, or getting caught in disadvantaged situations -driving, cooking, etc.- detecting this short period in real-time and predicting a seizure with machine learning to warn the user seemed as somewhat of a viable solution. After this initial ideation, sharing patient data such as allergies, medicinal history, emergency contacts, previous seizures, and essential information at the moment of attack for the emergency workers was thought out in the case of unresponsiveness from the user to the app's notification."},{"heading":"What does it do?","content":"The system contains the following: Three main agents. A smartwatch with an accurate ECG sensor. A machine learning algorithm on the cloud. An integrated notification app on mobile phones to retrieve patient information during attacks. The workflow includes a constant data transfer between the smartwatch and the machine learning algorithm to detect anomalies. If an attack is predicted, a notification prompts the user to check if this is a false positive prediction. Nothing is triggered if the user confirms nothing is wrong and dismisses the warning. The seizure protocol starts if the notification stays unattended or is answered as positive.\n\nSeizure Protocol Includes: -The user is warned by the prediction and should have found a safe space/position/situation to handle the seizure -Alarms from both synced devices, mobile, and smartwatch -Display of the FHIR patient history on the synced device, allergies, medicinal data, and fundamental id info for emergency healthcare workers -Contacting emergency numbers recorded for the individual\n\nWith the help of the app, we prevent further damage by accidents by predicting the seizure. After the episode, we help the emergency workers have a smoother experience assisting the patient."},{"heading":"Building the System","content":"We attempted to use Zepp's smartwatch development environment to create a smartwatch app to track and communicate with the cloud (Though there have been problems with the ECG sensors, which will be mentioned in the challenges section.) For the machine learning algorithm, we used an LSTM model (Long-Short Term Memory Networks) to slice up the continuously fed data and classify between \"normal\" and \"abnormal\" states after training it on both Mit-Bih Epileptic Seizure Recognition datasets we have found. If the \"abnormal\" form has been observed for more than the threshold, we have classified it as a \"seizure predictor.\" When the state changed to the seizure protocol, we had two ways of information transfer, one is to the smartwatch as an alarm/notification, and the other one to the synced mobile app to display information. For the mobile app, we have created a React Native app for the users to create profiles and transfer/display health information via the InterSystem's FHIR.js package. While in the \"listening\" state, the app waits for the seizure notification. When it receives it, it fetches and displays health information/history/emergency contacts and anything that can be useful to the emergency healthcare worker on the lock screen without unlocking the phone. Thus, providing a safer and smoother experience for the patient and the healthcare workers."},{"heading":"Challenges","content":"There have been several challenges and problems that we have encountered in this project. Some of them stayed unresolved, and some of them received quick fixes.\n\nThe first problem was using the ECG function of the Zepp watches. Because the watch ECG function was disabled in the U.S. due to a legal issue with the FDA, we could not pull up live data in the Hackathon. We resolved this issue by finding a premade ECG dataset and doing the train-test-validation on this premade dataset for the sake of providing a somewhat performing model for the Hackathon.\n\nThe second problem we encountered was that we could only measure our accuracy with our relatively mid-sized dataset. In the future, testing it with various datasets, trying sequential algorithms, and optimizing layers and performance would be advised. In the current state, without a live information feed and a comprehensive dataset, it is hard to be sure about the issues of overfitting/underfitting the dataset."},{"heading":"Accomplishments","content":"We could create a viable machine learning algorithm to predict seizures in a concise time frame, which took a lot of effort, research, and trials, especially in the beginning since we switched from plain RNN to LSTM due to the short-time frame problem. However, our algorithm works with a plausible accuracy (Keeping in mind that we cannot check for overfitting/underfitting without a diverse dataset). Another achievement we are proud of is that we attempted to build a project with many branches, like ReactApp, Zepp Integration, and Machine Learning in Python, which forced us to experience a product-development process in a super-dense mode.\n\nBut most importantly, attending the Hackathon and meeting with amazing people that both organized, supported, and competed in it was an achievement to appreciate!"},{"heading":"Points to Take Home","content":"The most discussed point we learned was that integrating many APIs is a rather daunting process in terms of developing something within 24 hours. It was much harder to adapt and link these different technologies together, even though we had anticipated it before attempting it. The second point we learned was that we needed to be careful about our resources during the challenges. Especially our assumption about the live-data feed from the watch made us stumble in the development process a bit. However, these problems make Hackathons a learning experience, so it's all good!"},{"heading":"Future for PulseBud","content":"The plans might include sharpening the ML with a variety of dense and large-scale datasets and optimizing the prediction methodology to reach the lowest latency with the highest accuracy. We might also try to run it on the watch itself if it can get a robust state like that. Also, setting personalized thresholds for each user would be much more efficient in terms of notification frequency if the person is an outlier. Also, handling the live data feed to the algorithm should be the priority. If these can be done to the full extent, this application can be a very comfortable quality of life change for many people who experience or might experience seizures."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"fhir javascript kaggle node.js python pytorch react-native zepp-sdk"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Ptolemy","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/ptolemy","tagline":"Securing the chain by providing more relevant data of validators using Sonr's DID module.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 9.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks90.devpost.com/","prize_name":"3rd Place Overall"},{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 9.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks90.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Sonr Tech Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"chakra","url":null},{"name":"golang","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/golang"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"sonr","url":null},{"name":"typescript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/typescript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/sehyunc/ptolemy"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As more and more blockchains transition to using Proof of Stake as their primary consensus mechanism, the importance of validators becomes more apparent. The security of entire digital economies, people's assets, and global currencies rely on the security of the chain, which at its core is guaranteed by the number of tokens that are staked by validators. These staked tokens not only come from validators but also from everyday users of the network. In the current system there is very little distinguishing between validators other than the APY that each provides and their name (a.k.a. their brand). We aim to solve this issue with Ptolemy by creating a reputation score that is tied to a validator's DID using data found both on and off chain.\n\nThis pain point was discovered as our club, being validators on many chains such as Evmos, wanted a way to earn more delegations through putting in more effort into pushing the community forward. After talking with other university blockchain clubs, we discovered that the space was seriously lacking the UI and data aggregation processes to correlate delegations with engagement and involvement in a community.\n\nWe confirmed this issue by realizing our shared experiences as users of these protocols: when deciding which validators to delegate our tokens to on Osmosis we really had no way of choosing between validators other than judging based on APY looking them up on Twitter to see what they did for the community."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Ptolemy calculates a reputation score based on a number of factors and ties this score to validators on chain using Sonr's DID module. These factors include both on-chain and off-chain metrics. We fetch on-chain validator data Cosmoscan and assign each validator a reputation score based on number of blocks proposed, governance votes, amount of delegators, and voting power, and create and evaluate a Validator based on a mathematical formula that normalized data gives them a score between 0-5. Our project includes not only the equation to arrive at this score but also a web app to showcase what a delegation UI would look like when including this reputation score. We also include mock data that ties data from social media platforms to highlight a validator's engagement with the community, such as Reddit, Twitter, and Discord, although this carries less weight than other factors."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"First, we started with a design doc, laying out all the features. Next, we built out the design in Figma, looking at different Defi protocols for inspiration. Then we started coding.\n\nWe built it using Sonr as our management system for DIDs, React, and Chakra for the front end, and the backend in GoLang."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Integrating the Sonr API was quite difficult, we had to hop on call with an Engineer from the team to work through the bug. We ended up having to use the GoLang API instead of the Flutr SDK. During the ideating phase, we had to figure out what off-chain data was useful for choosing between validators."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud of learning a new technology stack from the ground up in the form of the Sonr DID system and integrating it into a much-needed application in the blockchain space. We are also proud of the fact that we focused on deeply understanding the validator reputation issue so that our solution would be comprehensive in its coverage."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned how to bring together diverse areas of software to build a product that requires so many different moving components. We also learned how to look through many sets of documentation and learn what we minimally needed to hack out what we wanted to build within the time frame. Lastly, we also learned to efficiently bring together these different components in one final product that justice to each of their individual complexities."},{"heading":"What's next for Ptolemy","content":"Ptolemy is named in honor of the eponymous 2nd Century scientist who generated a system to chart the world in the form of longitude/latitude which illuminated the geography world. In a similar way, we hope to bring more light to the decision making process of directing delegations. Beyond this hackathon, we want to include more important metrics such as validator downtime, jail time, slashing history, and history of APY over a certain time period. Given more time, we could have fetched this data from an indexing service similar to The Graph. We also want to flesh out the onboarding process for validators to include signing into different social media platforms so we can fetch data to determine their engagement with communities, rather than using mock data. A huge feature for the app that we didn't have time to build out was staking directly on our platform, which would have involved an integration with Keplr wallet and the staking contracts on each of the appchains that we chose.\n\nBesides these staking related features, we also had many ideas to make the reputation score a bigger component of everyone's on chain identity. The idea of a reputation score has huge network effects in the sense that as more users and protocols use it, the more significance it holds. Imagine a future where lending protocols, DEXes, liquidity mining programs, etc. all take into account your on-chain reputation score to further align incentives by rewarding good actors and slashing malicious ones. As more protocols integrate it, the more power it holds and the more seriously users will manage their reputation score. Beyond this, we want to build out an API that also allows developers to integrate our score into their own decentralized apps.\n\nAll this is to work towards a future where Ptolemy will fully encapsulate the power of DID’s in order to create a more transparent world for users that are delegating their tokens.\n\nBefore launch, we need to stream in data from Twitter, Reddit, and Discord, rather than using mock data. We will also allow users to directly stake our platform. Then we need to integrate with different lending platforms to generate the Validator's \"reputation-score\" on-chain. Then we will launch on test net. Right now, we have the top 20 validators, moving forwards we will add more validators. We want to query, jail time, and slashing of validators in order to create a more comprehensive reputation score for the validator., Off-chain, we want to aggregate Discord, Reddit, Twitter, and community forum posts to see their contributions to the chain they are validating on. We also want to create an API that allows developers to use this aggregated data on their platform."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"chakra golang react sonr typescript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"SniffSniff","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/sniffsniff","tagline":"SniffSniff & Sniffodoo will help you sniff out the right link to your class’s discord/slack and allow you to skip reading through hundreds of unread messages by summarizing important information.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/259/781/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 9.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks90.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Beginner Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"beautiful-soup","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/beautiful-soup"},{"name":"co:here","url":null},{"name":"cockroachdb","url":null},{"name":"discord-apis","url":null},{"name":"figma","url":null},{"name":"heroku","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"nextjs","url":null},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"procreate","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"requests","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/requests"},{"name":"selenium","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/selenium"},{"name":"sellenium-reactjs-nextjs-nodejs-coackroachdb-sql-co:here-heroku-discord-apis-figma","url":null},{"name":"sql","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sql"}],"external_links":[{"label":"sniffsniff.herokuapp.com","url":"http://sniffsniff.herokuapp.com/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/RagsToHrishes/SniffSniff"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Our inspiration is from just our everyday lives and seeing other students' pain points.

Subsequently, we imported our data into the backend of our website. The bot was built in python using Discord.py to scrape data from a channel and then using co:here’s NLP API to analyze, summarize and classify the data. We used a lot of different kind of models and endpoints from co:here's API to accomplish the functionality including text summarizers, information extractors, and sentiment analyzers.

Our App Developer previously worked with only Web Apps with SQL databases. However, NoSQL works a little differently and doesn't have a robust referential system. Therefore writing Queries for our Read Operations was tricky.\n\nWith the core tech of the project relying heavily on the Google Cloud Platform, we had to resolve to unconventional methods to utilize its capabilities with an internet that played Russian roulette."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"The project has various hardware and software components like raspberry pi, Flutter, XRP Ledger Escrow, and Firebase, which all have their own independent frameworks.

Over the course of the hackathon, we discussed the idea with friends and fellow participants and gained a pretty good Proof of Concept giving us the confidence that we can do a city-wide launch of the project in the near future. In order to see these ambitions come to life, we would have to improve our Object Detection and Facial Recognition models. From cardboard, we would like to see our lockers carved in metal at every corner of this city. As we continue to grow our skills as programmers we believe our product Lendit will grow with it.

As fellow first-year grad students, we all had trouble figuring out what the culture here is at Berkeley.\n\nThe broader inspiration for this product came as a result of the fact that we live in such an unprecedented time as students. The impacts that worldly current events to day-to-day interactions have on our mental health is tremendous.

On the design side, our fun moody graphics were hand-drawn. The component system and styles were all written from scratch with the exception of Material UI's select dropdown menu. The data visualizations and the backend gets a little interesting. We trained a model of words using Natural Language Processing to obtain a numerical sentiment to measure the severity of the words in each category. By randomizing sets of words in each user session (tracked by a randomized cryptographic hash), a user submission of their mood will go into our Firebase database. As a result of unprecedented and unexpected challenges along the way in regards to Firebase async issues as well as Flask environments, a significant portion of our project was substituted by \"dummy data\" to mock the representation of our user inputs.

But that doesn't mean we couldn't get it to work. The premise of Moodz lies on three main technical components: user input, database transactions, and data visualization. We were able to meet two of those metrics (user input and data visualization)! However, what set us back on database transactions was the result of unexpected async/await issues in obtaining Firebase Realtime DB data. While users were able to write into the DB, reading the DB was much more difficult.

After doing this, we can query the table to determine if we should push a notification to the user or not. 2) We also would like to finetune our machine learning more. For example, right now we classify articles by topic broadly (such as War, COVID, Sports etc) and show a related positive article in the same category.

The real-time graph displays a rolling-window live tally of the Guardians that have signed the past 1000 VAAs. This way, users can easily visualize network reliability and see that the guardians with little to no recent transactions are probably offline. Additionally, by inputting a notional amount and chain id, users can also estimate if their transaction will be successful based on guardian availablity and single transaction notional amount."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We started by building an MVP for the transaction success estimator and concurrently worked on getting guardian data feeds directly from the gossip network. We ran a spy relay in a Digital Ocean droplet, which we used to provide a live VAA broadcast feed to our backend via RPC.

The information required for our transaction success estimator was pulled in from the public endpoints from available guardians."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Cross-chain Wormhole transactions must be signed off by 13 of 19 \"guardians\" to be considered valid. Thus, we needed information from all 19 guardians to reliably predict whether or not cross-chain transactions will fail. However, only 7 of the 19 guardians provide public APIs, so the rest needed to be collected directly from the Gossip network that the guardians broadcast to. This posed a significant challenge for us, since the current \"spy\" relay implemtation supports only listening for VAA (Verified Action Approvals) and not the Heartbeat events that we were interested in. We compromised by using only the publically available APIs for the transaction success estimator and supplementing it with live feeds from the VAA spy relay."},{"heading":"Future","content":"We managed to get something useful(maybe?) out there for everyone using the wormhole bridge.

According to the Museum Association, museum grant funding has dropped by over 20% over the last few years. As a result, museums have been forced to drop collections entirely, preventing public citizens from appreciating their beauty. Artful enables museums to create NFT and experiential bundles, which can be sold to the public as a method of fundraising.

Additionally, we were attempting to develop a custom NFT transfer smart contract with Solana, which was quite difficult. However, we soon found Eluv.io which eliminated these challenges and allowed us to focus development on our own platform.\n\nOverall, our largest challenge was automation. Specifically, the integration of automatically processing an uploaded image, utilizing the Eluv.io content fabric to create marketplaces and content objects in a manner that worked well with our existing frontend modules, generating the NFTs using an automated workflow, and publishing the NFT to the blockchain proved to be quite difficult due to the number of moving parts."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We’re incredibly proud of the scope and end-to-end completion of our website and application.

While it may have been possible to quit in the face of relentless issues in the back-end coding and instead pursue a more theoretical approach (in which we suggest functionality rather than implement it), we chose to persist, and it paid off. The whole chain of commands which previously required manual input through command line and terminal has been condensed into an automated process and contained to a single file of new code."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Through initially starting with a completely from scratch Ethereum private blockchain using geth and smart contracts in Solidity, we developed a grounding in how blockchains actually work and the extensive infrastructure that enables decentralization. Moreover, we recognized the power of APIs in using Eluv.io’s architecture after learning it from the ground up. The theme of our project was fundamentally integration—finding ways to integrate our frontend user authentication and backend Eluv.io Ethereum blockchain, and seeing how to integrate the Eluv.io interface with our own custom web app. There were many technical challenges along the way in learning a whole new API, but through this journey, we feel much more comfortable with both our ability as programmers and our understanding of blockchain, a topic which before this hackathon, none of us had really developed familiarity with. By talking a lot with the Eluv.io CEO and founder who helped us tremendously with our project too, we learned a lot about their own goals and aspirations, and we can safely say that we’ve emerged from this hackathon with a much deeper appreciation and curiosity for blockchain and use cases of dapps."},{"heading":"What's next for Artful","content":"Artful plans to incorporate direct communications with museums by building a more robust fundraising network, where donators can contribute to the restoration of art or the renovation of an exhibit by purchasing one of the many available copies of a specific NFT.

Fundamentally, we hope that our virtual center can act as a centralized hub for high-end art transfer worldwide, which through blockchain’s security, ensures the solidity (haha) of transactions will redefine the art buying/selling industry. Moreover, our website also acts as a proof of credibility as well — by connecting transactions with corresponding NFTs on the blockchain, we can ensure that every transaction occurring on our website is credible, and so as it scales up, the act of not using our website and dealing art underhandedly represents a loss of credibility. And most importantly, by integrating decentralization with the way high-end art NFTs are stored, we hope to bring the beautiful yet esoteric world of art to more people, further creating a platform for up and coming artists to establish their mark on a new age of digital creators."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroach-db eluvio ethereum ganache html/css javascript next.js node.js react solidity truffle"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Wake the F*ck Up","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/wake-the-f-ck-up","tagline":"Use the power of friendship to never sleep through an alarm ever again.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/259/208/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 9.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks90.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Google Cloud Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"cockroach-db","url":null},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"google-cloud","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cloud"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javacript","url":null},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"react","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react"},{"name":"sqlalchemy","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/sqlalchemy"},{"name":"twilio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/twilio"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/thomaspwang/WakeTheF-ckUp"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Standing atop the zenith of inconceivable scientific ingenuity and unimaginable advancements in modern technology, we have overcome an unthinkable number of obstacles facing the human race from treating lethal diseases to vastly increasing agricultural output.

Missed job interviews, late first-date brunches, failed midterms; too many unfortunate souls have lost their livelihoods to this behavioral ailment.\n\n... but the answer is clear.

Each friend can choose whether or not to take the charge of waking you up; if they don’t, the responsibility will be passed onto the next friend. If none of your friends want to wake you up, no worries: we’ll call 911.\n\nUser Authentication!\n\nOur app supports user authentication! You can log in with a username and password, and sign up by inputting the address you’d like to be woken up at, along with your phone number.\n\nAdd Friends!\n\nAdd your friends to your friends’ list, where you can set them to be on-call for alarms.\n\nAlarm!\n\nYou can set a date and time for your alarm to ring. Here’s how it works:\n\nWhen the alarm goes off, we’ll call you at your phone number! If there’s no response after 10 seconds, we’ll call the on-call friend that’s closest to you and tell them to go to your address and wake you up! If a friend either chooses not to wake you up (through texting back “yes” or “no” to a text message) or doesn’t respond in 10 seconds, we’ll call the next on-call friend that’s closest to you. Step 3 will keep repeating until there are no friends left! In that case, we’ll call 911 because you’ll definitely wake up with police at your door."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Using React and JavaScript, we built Wake the F*ck up as a full-stack web application. For our backend, we used Python, Flask, sqlalchemy, Serverless CockRoachDB, and Google Cloud Engine for hosting. Our project consists of 3 major technical components:\n\nTwilio Messaging and Calling\n\nWhen your alarm goes off, we use Twilio to call and message you and your friends. We spawn a process for each alarm activation; each parent thread is responsible for sending Twilio robot calls and messages, receiving back a response and routing it to our backend API, and timing out after 10 seconds to notify the next friend. This allows the server to continuously process multiple alarms from different users without having to wait for child processes to finish.\n\nHowever, to handle the case where you might have multiple outgoing alarms at once, we set up inter-process communication for all alarm processes to share memory while using locks and semaphores to prevent race conditions; this allows each process to serially update their state in a queued buffer such that our backend knows which text response was for which alarm instance.\n\nGeocoding and Geolocations\n\nWhen users sign up to Wake the F*ck Up, they input the address where they want to be woken up. Behind the hood though, we actually use Google API geocoding to translate that address to a latitude and longitude coordinate. Then, to decide the order of your friends to call when your alarm goes off, we sort your on-call friends by calculating their distance from you (even taking into account the curvature of the earth!).\n\nUser Interface\n\nFor our UI, we wanted to focus on simplicity, cleanliness, and neutral aesthetics. After all, we felt it was important to juxtapose the stress of potentially losing friends and having the police at your door with a sense of calm, cuteness, and sunshine. That’s why we hand-drew all our bees from scratch!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"To start, one of the major challenges we had was getting everything … to just work.

With people scrolling short videos endlessly on the most popular apps such as Tiktok, Instagram, and Youtube, we thought, why not provide a similar service but for texts that can not only be fun but also productive? As a group of college students occupied with not only school but also hobbies and goals, we envisioned an app that can summarize any kind of long text effectively so that while we can get the essence of the text, we can also spend more time on other important things. Without having to ask someone to provide a TL;DR for us, we wanted to generate it ourselves in a matter of few seconds, which will help us get the big picture of the text. TL;DR is applicable anywhere, from social media such as Reddit and Messenger to Wikipedia and academic journals, that are able to pick out the most essentials in just one click.\n\nEver on a crunch for time to read a 10-page research paper?

Twilio is also used for user authentication as well as exporting a TL;DR from your laptop to your phone.\n\nWe utilized Co:here’s APIs extensively, making use of the text summarization and sentiment classifier endpoints. Leveraging Beautiful Soup’s capability to extract information, these pair together to generate the output needed by our app. In addition, we went above and beyond to better the NLP landscape by allowing our users to make modifications to Co:here’s generations, which we can send to Co:here. Through this, we are empowering a community of users that help support the development of accessible ML and get their work done as well - win/win!"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Every successful project comes with its own challenges, and we sure had to overcome some bugs and obstacles along the way! First, we took our time settling on the perfect idea, as we all wanted to create something that really impacts the lives of fellow students and the general population.

With increasing reliance on and availability of technology, cyber security is more important now than ever before; we hackers need a reliable, intuitive interface which that can protect our data and save us time. We keep Polish running local on the user's device, which allows our users to maintain control over their own data, and their own writing.\n\n(Disclaimer: This paragraph was not written with Grammarly)"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Polish is here for your writing– or reading– needs.

With safety being an ever growing issue, we know we need our users to trust the solution that we provide. \"\n\nPolish also works to finish sentences through its AI-generated recommendations. These can provide creative and useful endings for any sentence starters you desire. Writer's block? Just allow Polish to find a sentence ending that works for you. Not enough time? All you need is a few sentence starters to generate whole paragraphs of text in a fraction of the time. Whether you need something to cure boredom, spark creativity, or save time, Polish has an array of features to work for your specific needs."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"One of the biggest goals for this project is to move all computationally expensive and data handling components off of the cloud and onto the user's device for enhanced control over the model and user data privacy.\n\nTo achieve this we first identified some datasets, namely ASSET for summarization and JFLEG for grammatical correction and combining both datasets to create a sentence completion dataset.\n\nThen, we chose T5 for its multitasking capabilities (and existing pretraining on summarization) to finetune on this dataset.\n\nFollowing this, we began to build the webapp. As this space of running Transformer models on the edge is very poorly documented/not documented at all, we ended up translating inference and tokenization code from a variety of sources from python to js. To save on time, our frontend is built on vanilla HTML/CSS/JS."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Many of our team members are new to building web applications, and had to learn HTML/CSS/JS from scratch There is very little exploration into running natural language on the edge (ore even with tensorflowjs). However, this didn't keep us from managing to create a working model that works on laptops and (select, non-apple) mobile devices!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud that Polish is so user friendly. We created this product with user's interests in mind, hoping to ease their worries in the domain of safety while maximizing speed and visibility into what the model is actually doing by moving traditionally server-side data directly into users' hands in the browser. Furthermore, we made sure to focus on creating an accessible product by making the text size adjustable, adapting to various screen sizes with ease. With a smooth zooming feature, the smaller text can be enlarged for users. We believe that creating the best experience will not only provide a good technical site for writing amelioration but also a product users will love."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"As our team is majority beginners, we struggled acclimating ourselves to JavaScript. However, this has been a wonderful learning opportunity, as we familiarize ourselves with JavaScript, HTML, cleaning data, and training our model. We learned a lot about web development, and about all the parts that come together to create this product. Another very important lesson we learned is task prioritization (even without systems such as boards to keep track of them). We were often sidetracked building fun and quirky features or sharing a laugh over the dumb things the model generated."},{"heading":"What's next for Polish","content":"As great of a product that Polish is after one continuous sleep-deprived coding session, we believe that it has a lot of room to grow. We are hoping to do more extensive debugging, resolving fundamental architecture flaws, and moving on to more industry standard frameworks, such as react native. We then want to optimize Polish to work better on cell phones by creating a mobile app and taking advantage of the more robust frameworks, such as tensorflow lite. This way it will be more distributable and have a wider market. We also believe in constantly bettering our model, because we know that we can never be perfect. Optimizing the model inference speed and memory efficiency would be the natural next steps for making Polish the natural option for customers.
