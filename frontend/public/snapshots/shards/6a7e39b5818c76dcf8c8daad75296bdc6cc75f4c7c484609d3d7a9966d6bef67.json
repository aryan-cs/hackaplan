The all the money is collected by USustain(us) where its algorithmically dispersed to a student in need. Students: The students will be able to view number of meals they have available and they can choose to find restaurants around their school to redeem the meals. They can choose to order from online food delivery services to deliver the materials to prepare the meals to save time. PayPal/Venmo: The company will be able to track hotspots where most students are buying their meals so that the company can form better vendor relationships in those areas. The company will also be able to boost the spendings on their PayPal and Venmo mastercards at restaurants."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built the app to be modern and functional using a ReactJs with Material UI to follow the current design standards. To enable donations we enabled Braintree API with Spring Boot backend and React to allow for drop in UI components.

Coming up with a solution that could potentially benefit all the parties involved, improved our morale about working on the project. Members who had no prior experience working on Enterprise Spring Java applications and frontend React-Native were able to learn and adapt fast enough to contribute to the project. Getting all the frontend and the backend tied up successfully along getting Braintree and PayPal APIs to successfully process the payments was a wonderful feeling."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"PayPal's company culture and types of products being worked on! How to budget time for shorter hackathons with more focus! How to successfully dabble in frontend and backend technologies without prior experience."},{"heading":"What's next for USustain","content":"We truly believe there is a product market fit for USustain in America. Based on the research performed and businesses analysed, the business model has been thoroughly vetted to benefit all the parties involved. Some of the future technical improvements include:\n\nWays to calculate meal value based on current location of the person Creating a more empowering donor page where donors would want to donate their money Ways to provide students with more options for meals instead of just local restaurants or online delivery Build a analytics platform to observe students life and important life changes and incorporate need more deeply.

Glim strives to revolutionize the debt repayment process by empowering users take control of their financial lives. Through the use of a friendly, interactive mascot and persistent notifications that learns your behavior, we make debt seem less daunting.\n\nCredit card debt plagues a large portion of the United States population with high interest rates and non-active notifications for payments, often allowing credit card holders to be negligent about their debt. While a healthy portion of credit card users are transactors (30.4%), most credit card users are revolvers (43.8%). In other words, most people are not paying off what they directly owe to credit cards companies and are putting balances off to have interest tacked onto them.\n\nWhen average interest rates run around 16.86% and can run as high as 30%, this balance can accumulate quickly. The credit card companies aren't going to remind you how quickly the bills stack up - so we're going to."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"If you procrastinate on paying back your debts, you will be notified that \"You really should be paying this back. You racked up $14.47 in interest the past month.\"\n\nIs that too harsh? You can also switch to Zen mode for more friendly reminders such as: \"Try to get in your next credit card payment! It's due November 25!\"\n\nAs you keep streaks on paying the debts in time, you will grow with your otter and you can customize with in-app currency. The emotional bond is there to support both yourself and your virtual furry friend. Current research about similar approaches indicates that the humorous and dynamic component of these notifications helps users get more engaged with product, and hence the debt repayment process."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Sketch to model the design of the app and to develop our mascot, Otto. We used React Native to build the mobile application and Github to share our code."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Getting all the infrastructure set up to develop this app took longer than we all previously thought. We learned the importance of planning ahead to make sure we hit the grown running (or coding!) when we meet as a team. Likewise, we also found it challenging to divide the workload into small, discrete tasks: this is another area where early planning would be a huge help."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud of creating an application that is mission driven and gives people agency over their own financial lives. We have implemented most of the features that we have planned on. We're also proud of deepening our understanding of mobile development tools like React Native and Javascript. Lastly, we're proud that we all managed to fall asleep in some very interesting resting positions."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"This Hackathon was definitely an educational experience for all of us. For those of us working with mobile development for the first time, we realized how time-consuming and difficult the process of installing dependencies and software can be. We also learned the importance of conceptualizing of a minimum viable product and prioritizing all tasks and functions that relate to said product. We can't expect ourselves to implement all of our ideas in one night--no matter how much caffeine!"},{"heading":"What's next for Team - 1","content":"We have several ideas we'd like to implement with Glim in the future.\n\nWe'd like to make it easier for users to add credit cards. Instead of manually inputting credit card information, we might use APIs from credit card companies in order to automatically get their credit card information given the credit card number. We'd like to add options for different kinds of debt and financial obligations so that the user could keep track of that if the so please. We'd add a payment planner so that if the user is interested in ways they can pay out their debt, the app shows them in what ways it can be done. We'd like to develop a smarter algorithm for pushing notifications so that the tone and frequency can be adjusted in accordance with user responses. We'd also like to add more dynamic data visualization functions, wherein users are provided with graphs and infographics depicting their debt over time."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"adobe-illustrator javascript react-native sketch"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com docs.google.com"}]},{"project_title":"ATU","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/averis","tagline":"Interactive, Virtual Assistant","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"PayPal Hack-Chicago","hackathon_url":"https://paypal-hack-chicago.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Idea"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"sapi","url":null},{"name":"vb.net","url":null}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"What's next for Averis","content":"Placeholder"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"sapi vb.net"}]},{"project_title":"Fi","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/fi","tagline":"Social savings for the new generation.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"PayPal Hack-Chicago","hackathon_url":"https://paypal-hack-chicago.devpost.com/","prize_name":"3rd Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"mongoose","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongoose"},{"name":"react-native","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/react-native"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/PayPalHack-Chicago/Team-16"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"User problem: building and maintaining saving habits ⇒ mastering delayed gratification"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Rationale: Fi automatically saves x% of income each day based on user-specified goals Differentiation: social, points-based system creates incentive through competitive spirit at 0 cost to Fi"},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"Backend: Express.JS, Mongoose, and MongoDB\n\nlogin + signup features store user data, e.g. friends list, financial information, account information Frontend: React-Native leverage database to construct graphical models, e.g. charts, leaderboard"},{"heading":"What's next for Fi","content":"Future features:\n\nUser sets savings goal of x% ⇒ x points/day Add points based on savings streak Leaderboard with friends to foster competitive spirit Level system Customization options, e.g. user avatars, purchase virtual items with points Optional: automatically deposit into savings account at the end of each month"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"express.js mongodb mongoose react-native"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"A simulation of the wealth of college graduates.","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/15","tagline":"Describe an individual's expected value from their major","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/858/726/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"PayPal Hack-Chicago","hackathon_url":"https://paypal-hack-chicago.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Implementation"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/PayPalHack-Chicago/Team-15"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We started by discussing simulating a person's financial future as part of a mobile app, but we decided that form didn't make sense.
