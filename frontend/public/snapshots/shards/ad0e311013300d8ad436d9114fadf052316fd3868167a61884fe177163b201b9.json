From the topic of fighting harassment, I modeled my hack around an app that intends to fight sexual assault."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The goal of my app is two-fold. The first is to alert emergency services (medical and law enforcement) in a minimal amount of time and in the least conspicuous way possible. By merely opening an app and pushing a button, I reached the optimal balance between reducing human error and app-practicality. The second goal was to create a platform for people in the area to aid or intervene in the act of harassment. By notifying other users of the app in the proximity of the incident, it would increase the chances of being rescued."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"I used Java and Android Studio to build the app and Java on NetBeans to host a server. I used the Twilio API to send SMS and receive SMS."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Initially, I wanted to use Amazon AWS, but I ran into problems because I was too young to sgn up for the service, even though I had credits. Additionally, since this product brings numerous device together, it was difficult to create a synergy between all of them. Some of the APIs that I used were paid, so finding quality alternatives proved difficult. At the end of the day, I bypassed almost all the major problems."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"I feel my app could be deployed in the real world and have a _ real _ impact on the world. I believe that is the true spirit of hackathons: to make things simpler and better."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"I learned to never underestimate the complicatedness of languages you know so well. Too many times we are taught things in schools, think we understand it, but when we apply it, everything crumbles. I've done numerous java programs, but the language never ceases to confuse me."},{"heading":"What's next for Antidote","content":"I hope to utilize AWS and keep servers constantly running instead of being dependent on my computer being on and running the server."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android-studio gradle java json maven xml"}]},{"project_title":"Exterminat0r","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/exterminat0r","tagline":"Exterminat0r is a multi-platform VR first-person shooter game with complex character and projectile motion.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/485/825/datas/medium.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Domain Name from Domain.com"},{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Major League Hacking Medals"},{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"American Eagle's Choice"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"android-studio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/android-studio"},{"name":"google-cardboard","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard"},{"name":"samsung-gear-vr","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/samsung-gear-vr"},{"name":"unreal-engine","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unreal-engine"},{"name":"webvr","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"virtualrealityontheinter.net","url":"http://virtualrealityontheinter.net/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Virtual reality has become a sexy trend in the entertainment industry, so we set out to create an immersive and expandable VR experience."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We created 2 separate first person VR games. The first is categorized as an arcade style game, where the user shoots various blocks in order to score points. The second is more of a single player survival game, where the individual defends himself against an endless wave of enemies."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used aframe.io for the arcade style game, which is a web-based VR platform allowing the application to be run on a variety of devices, from Google Cardboard to normal PCs. For the survival game, we used Unreal Engine, a professional software designed for industrial use with more complex features, but limited in terms of platforms support."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"As we only had 1 Xbox controller to demo, we tried to build a homebrew controller using an Arduino 101 with Bluetooth, a joystick, and a set of buttons. Unfortunately, the Arduino's \"Low Energy\" Bluetooth technology did not allow the latency we wanted from the controller - the inputs were too sluggish to be used effectively in an actual game."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"The development of the single player endless individual mode, as it was the one we struggled the most with. We are most proud of developing two separate games side by side with time to experiment with new hardware. We are also satisfied in our efforts in targeting a large market: WebVR, available on low cost hardware with simple graphics, and Unreal Engine, requiring more high fidelity hardware but featuring more complexity."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"We learned a lot about the coordination required to develop a mobile game. Individuals all had to be on the same page at the same time otherwise various conflicts would arise. Code-wise, we had to learn to utilize new Javascript libraries for creating the WebVR game. We also largely improved working together as a team, rotating roles and making sure everyone was making progress."},{"heading":"What's next for Exterminat0r","content":"We hope to be able to develop a finalized version of both the arcade and the endless mode in the future, perhaps combining them into one. Various minor bugs will need to be 'exterminated' in order to allow a successful launch."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android-studio google-cardboard samsung-gear-vr unreal-engine webvr"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"virtualrealityontheinter.net"}]},{"project_title":"Impossible Boxing Train","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/impossible-boxing-train","tagline":"We randomed a game in video game generator","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/485/890/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Major League Hacking Medals"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"gamemaker","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/gamemaker"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We wanted to make a fun game with new ideas"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"play through a series of train cars"},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"We coded and animated a series of maps, enemys and players"},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Implimenting the animations into the game"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"The characters and their models"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"Coding a video game is a team effort and everyone maters"},{"heading":"What's next for Impossible Boxing Train","content":"we may continue making it after the hackathon"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"gamemaker"}]},{"project_title":"DunkIt","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/dunkit","tagline":"Ever wanted to know how high you need to jump to dunk a basketball or how well you stack up against the pros?","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/485/748/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"MakeSchool Sponsorship"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"xcode","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/xcode"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/samliokumovich/DunkIT/issues/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We always wondered what it would take to Dunk in basketball.

We decided to create an iOS app surrounding basketball to explore these ideas, while also expanding Xcode knowledge."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"This app calculates the height that one must jump in order to dunk a basketball, along with providing a comparison of one's capabilities to the pros based on their current skill level."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Xcode and Swift to code for this app, including the creation of a storyboard which we designed for optimal performance."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"This is our first, but not last, attempt to create an iOS app. Ever. Youtube was our guide for the majority of the process, sometimes confusing us even further. We had difficulties debugging our source code as we are mostly unfamiliar with the syntax of Swift."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We learned to engage with many new objects in Xcode - activating sliders and pickers, filling tables, and navigating buttons."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We managed to learn the basics of Swift through this app exploration, which spiked our interest in continuing in more projects in Swift."},{"heading":"What's next for DunkIt","content":"This model could expand out to not only basketball but to other areas including, but not limited to, swimming , archery , track and field , Major League Gaming and our personal favorite Hackathons ."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"swift xcode"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Polytar","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/polytar","tagline":"A Virtual Reality game that utilizes a rockband guitar to shoot down flying robot-targets.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/485/727/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Major League Hacking Medals"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"blender","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blender"},{"name":"fl-studio-11","url":null},{"name":"photoshop","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/photoshop"},{"name":"steamvr","url":null},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"},{"name":"visual-studio","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/visual-studio"}],"external_links":[{"label":"bitbucket.org","url":"https://bitbucket.org/themissingp_ece/polytar-better"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Virtual Reality has become a huge rising technology, and we were interested in seeing how different input options would effect the overall game-play experience and immersion of a project. A Rock-band guitar was selected because it was something that we all had, and was easy to work with."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Polytar uses a rock-band guitar in tandem with an HTC Vive controller to create a virtual guitar that shoots lasers. In Polytar, you can choose between a few pre-selected songs to play along to while destroying as many robots as you can."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We designed and 3D printed a mount for the Vive controller before-hand so we could work with the guitar. After that, we used a wireless Xbox controller adapter to recognize it's input in Unity. From there, we split up the work between designing the AI, Sound Design, 3D Modeling, and Game Functionality. For creating levels, we made a basic level editor that lets you schedule when and how many enemies are to spawn."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Originally, Polytar was planned to be a multiplayer game. We learned after the first 5 hours of Hack//Ridge that we probably wouldn't be able to fit that in within 24 hours, especially for such a physics heavy game. We decided to abandon multiplayer support in favor of getting started on the actual game. It also was initially planned to have midi support, letting you play any song as long as it had the appropriate midi file. It turns out that the library we planned on using to access and read MIDI files had next to no documentation or support, so we quickly dropped that as well, and came up with our own solution."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud of being able to pull off our game in 24 hours. After wasting at least 6 hours on features that we could never get to work, we were worried about being able to pull through in time. We managed to finish our game with an hour to spare, which made us very proud."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Scope is a very important factor in any project. We dreamed up this perfect view of a coop VR rhythm game without thinking of the time we had to complete it. We also certainly learned a lot about handling a situation when it doesn't go as planned."},{"heading":"What's next for Polytar","content":"Outside of the hackathon, Polytar may _ eventually _ get midi support, but with college plans around the bend, we may have to focus on other things. It would be ideal to get Polytar to a state where it can be downloaded or sold online on a site like itch.io, but that would involve either greater user creation tools or an algorithm to automatically determine spawn rates for a song."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"blender fl-studio-11 photoshop steamvr unity visual-studio"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"bitbucket.org"}]},{"project_title":"Maine South Stage Crew","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/maine-south-stage-crew","tagline":"It's a convenient database for pictures of previous shows to be used as a reference in future projects.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack Ridge","hackathon_url":"https://hackridge.devpost.com/","prize_name":"American Eagle's Choice"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"}],"external_links":[{"label":"msstagecrew.com","url":"http://msstagecrew.com/"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Built With","content":"css html javascript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"msstagecrew.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-17T18:28:50.936401Z"}}
