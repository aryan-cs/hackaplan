Often times when lifting, people tend to employ poor form leading to gym injuries which could have been avoided by being proactive."},{"heading":"What it does and how we built it","content":"Our product tracks body movements using EMG signals from a Myo armband the athlete wears. During the activity, the application provides real-time tracking of muscles used, distance specific body parts travel and information about the athlete’s posture and form. Using machine learning, we actively provide haptic feedback through the band to correct the athlete’s movements if our algorithm deems the form to be poor."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We trained an SVM based on employing deliberately performed proper and improper forms for exercises such as bicep curls. We read properties of the EMG signals from the Myo band and associated these with the good/poor form labels. Then, we dynamically read signals from the band during workouts and chart points in the plane where we classify their forms. If the form is bad, the band provides haptic feedback to the user indicating that they might injure themselves."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Interfacing with the Myo bands API was not the easiest task for us, since we ran into numerous technical difficulties.

By collecting data from professional athletes, we can come up with “profiles” that the user can learn to play like. We can quantitatively and precisely assess how close the user is playing their chosen professional athlete.\n\nFor instance, we played tennis in high school and frequently had to watch videos of our favorite professionals.

Professors can begin a session that students in the lecture can join using some provided passcode. Upon joining the live session, students gain access to multiple features that provide an enhanced lecture experience. The dashboard has 3 main features:\n\nThe first is simply the lecture slides embedded into the left half of their screen––this is for the students to follow along with the presentation. The right side contains two tabs. One is a live transcript of what the professor is saying that updates in real time. The app parses the professor's words in real time to find relevant people, places etc. Each term deemed relevant has a hyperlink to additional resources. These keywords are also stored in a digest that we will send at the end. The third feature is an in-browser note taker that begins lecture with all the bullet points/text scraped from the powerpoint presentation. This way, students can focus on putting their own thoughts/notes instead of simply copying the lecture bullets.\n\nAt the end of the lecture, Megafind sends each student a copy of their \"lecture digest\" which contains 3 parts:\n\nA summary of the lecture created by performing natural language understanding on the transcript The notes taken by the student in lecture Each keyword that we picked up on compiled into a list with a short summary of its definition (for study guides/quick reference)"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css html javascript mlab"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"AiLean (AI+Learn)","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/ailean-ai-learn","tagline":"Conversational language learning assistant that provides an accessible platform for passionate linguists.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/545/813/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 4.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks4.devpost.com/","prize_name":"The Cal Hacks Fellowship"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"google-speech-to-text-api","url":null},{"name":"google-translate","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-translate"},{"name":"google-web-speech-api","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"How I built it","content":"To create the website, we used HTML, CSS and Sublime.

The build is named after our good friend Greg who let us borrow his stereocamera for the weekend, enabling this project."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The rig uses a ZED stereocamera driven by a ROS wrapper to take stereo images at various known poses in a spiral which is executed with precision by two stepper motors driving a leadscrew elevator and a turn table for the model to be scanned. We designed the entire build in a high detail CAD using Autodesk Fusion 360, 3D printed L-brackets and mounting hardware to secure the stepper motors to the T-slot aluminum frame we cut at the metal shop at Jacobs Hall. There are also 1/8th wood pieces that were laser cut at Jacobs, including the turn table itself. We designed the power system around an Arduino microcontroller and and an Adafruit motor shield to drive the steppers. The Arduino and the ZED camera are controlled by python over a serial port and a ROS wrapper respectively to automate the process of capturing the images used as an input to OpenMVG/MVS to compute dense point clouds and eventually refined meshes."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into a few minor mechanical design issues that were unforeseen in the CAD, luckily we had access to a 3D printer throughout the entire weekend and were able to iterate quickly on the tolerancing of some problematic parts. Issues with the AccelStepper library for Arduino used to simultaneously control the velocity and acceleration of 2 stepper motors slowed us down early Sunday evening and we had to extensively read the online documentation to accomplish the control tasks we needed to. Lastly, the complex 3D geometry of our rig (specifically rotation and transformation matrices of the cameras in our defined world coordinate frame) slowed us down and we believe is still problematic as the hackathon comes to a close."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're proud of the mechanical design and fabrication, actuator precision, and data collection automation we achieved in just 36 hours.

As a consequence, money is wasted and food waste is produced, thereby discounting the financially advantageous aspect of cooking and increasing the amount of food that is wasted. With this problem in mind, we built an iOS app that easily allows anyone to record and track expiration dates for groceries."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The app, iPerish, allows users to either take a photo of a receipt or load a pre-saved picture of the receipt from their photo library. The app uses Tesseract OCR to identify and parse through the text scanned from the receipt, generating an estimated expiration date for each food item listed. It then sorts the items by their expiration dates and displays the items with their corresponding expiration dates in a tabular view, such that the user can easily keep track of food that needs to be consumed soon. Once the user has consumed or disposed of the food, they could then remove the corresponding item from the list. Furthermore, as the expiration date for an item approaches, the text is highlighted in red."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Swift, Xcode, and the Tesseract OCR API. To generate expiration dates for grocery items, we made a local database with standard expiration dates for common grocery goods."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We found out that one of our initial ideas had already been implemented by one of CalHacks' sponsors. After discovering this, we had to scrap the idea and restart our ideation stage.\n\nChoosing the right API for OCR on an iOS app also required time. We tried many available APIs, including the Microsoft Cognitive Services and Google Computer Vision APIs, but they do not have iOS support (the former has a third-party SDK that unfortunately does not work, at least for OCR). We eventually decided to use Tesseract for our app.\n\nOur team met at Cubstart; this hackathon is our first hackathon ever! So, while we had some challenges setting things up initially, this made the process all the more rewarding!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We successfully managed to learn the Tesseract OCR API and made a final, beautiful product - iPerish. Our app has a very intuitive, user-friendly UI and an elegant app icon and launch screen. We have a functional MVP, and we are proud that our idea has been successfully implemented. On top of that, we have a promising market in no small part due to the ubiquitous functionality of our app."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"During the hackathon, we learned both hard and soft skills. We learned how to incorporate the Tesseract API and make an iOS mobile app. We also learned team building skills such as cooperating, communicating, and dividing labor to efficiently use each and every team member's assets and skill sets."},{"heading":"What's next for iPerish","content":"Machine learning can optimize iPerish greatly. For instance, it can be used to expand our current database of common expiration dates by extrapolating expiration dates for similar products (e.g. milk-based items). Machine learning can also serve to increase the accuracy of the estimates by learning the nuances in shelf life of similarly-worded products. Additionally, ML can help users identify their most frequently bought products using data from scanned receipts. The app could recommend future grocery items to users, streamlining their grocery list planning experience.\n\nAside from machine learning, another useful update would be a notification feature that alerts users about items that will expire soon, so that they can consume the items in question before the expiration date."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"ocr swift tesseract xcode"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Presentalk 2.0","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/presentalk-sjpe2v","tagline":"Efficient, Quick, Voice Controlled Presentations","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/543/983/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 4.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks4.devpost.com/","prize_name":"The Cal Hacks Fellowship"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"bing-images-api","url":null},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"google-cloud-vision","url":null},{"name":"google-web-speech-api","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-web-speech-api"},{"name":"html5","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html5"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"A brief recap of the inspiration for Presentalk 1.0: We wanted to make it easier to navigate presentations.

Firstly, students are easily able to fake their attendance by sending Google Form sign-in links and Top Hat codes to their friends who are skipping class. Although using TopHat and Google Forms are feasible options in very small classrooms so that professors can perform a quick head count to verify, larger classes make it impossible to verify student attendance.\n\nCollege instructors of larger classes often wonder if students are attending class regularly and paying attention. Today, iClickers are used as a classroom response system in larger classes. The hardware consists of a remote keypad device called clicker, a receiving device connected to a computer, and Reef software. iClicker models have limitations on the maximum number of clickers that can be supported in one classroom, thus making iclickers unscalable beyond a certain number. For example, computer science classes at Berkeley, with around 1800 students, would not be able to use clickers for attendance.\n\nFurther, using TopHat and Google Forms requires students to manually type in a URL and access a webpage, where they enter all of their student information and a secret attendance code. This code can be sent to a friend who is not present in the classroom within a matter of seconds, and the attendance is therefore inaccurate.\n\nAnother factor to consider is cost. TopHat subscription for each student is around $25 per semester. The iClickers are deployed to students at a total of $40 each, and the Reef software that supports iClickers costs the university and students an additional subscription fee! Students are responsible for carrying around the iClicker remote whenever they go to class, or else they do not receive credit for attendance, and the iClicker is subject to running out of charge. Students, in addition to paying $40 for the iClicker, must also pay $4 for batteries and are also responsible for replacing a broken iClicker, which comes with a very limited warranty.\n\nOur team is looking for a more cost-effective solution without the issue of fake attendance whereby friends try to send attendance URLs/codes or sneak in a friend’s iClicker. Hence, we thought of TickIn!"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"TickIn simply checks (“ticks”) you in. Using bluetooth and Arduino beacon technology, TickIn uses 3 simple steps to check students in.\n\nOnce the Arduino 101 beacon is turned on, it will emit low energy bluetooth waves. Then, any bluetooth device that is within a close range of the arduino beacon will detect the signal. When the TickIn app is installed on the smartphone, the app will detect the bluetooth device specific to a course, and ask the student to log in using their college credentials. Finally, the student will be able to press the send button if they are within the acceptable range of the arduino beacon, and the information will be sent to a web server. The server will collect, display, and analyze the data for the professor on a website using visual charts and graphics.\n\nTickIn’s technology is scalable to a class of virtually any size. For example, classes as large as 2000 students can use TickIn’s technology to ensure that students are present in class, and TickIn’s built-in web analytics can analyze the data for the professor on the TickIn website."},{"heading":"How We Built TickIn","content":"For the TickIn App: We used XML to design the architecture of the app and Java to design the back-end for the app via Android Studio. API’s involved with the application itself are the Android API and Java API.\n\nFor the Arduino(Beacon): We used the language C which directly approaches the hardware.\n\nFor retrieving data / website: We used HTML/CSS for the frontend of the website, JavaScript and Ruby which function as the bridge between the frontend and the backend, and Rails and SQL for the backend of the web as the database."},{"heading":"Challenges We Ran Into","content":"We expected to have beacons at the venue, but there were none available. We instead treated Arduino 101 as a beacon because it features wireless bluetooth connectivity. Further, since none of our team members have programmed bluetooth devices and worked with MAC Addresses, a substantial amount of research was performed."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that We're Proud Of","content":"Some student response systems that are currently in use are iClickers, Top Hat, and Google Forms. The current systems are coming at an unnecessary additional cost for the students.\n\nWe strongly believe this product is a cost effective and easy to use solution to the attendance problem at Berkeley, benefitting both students and the university.\n\nWe can extend the usage of TickIn to other universities and schools, and even outside classroom settings. For instance, large events like hackathons can use TickIn to avoid long queues for participant/attendee check-in.\n\nOverall, TickIn is portable as it is a smartphone application, requiring only the professor to carry the beacon around to their classrooms. TickIn is cost effective as the application can be deployed for a very low cost to the large student population and an estimated $25 for the professor. TickIn is scalable to any number of students and generates visually appealing reports on the data collected from the mobile app. Also, the same beacons can be shared between different classes by configuring the same ID for different timings and locations to identify another class. Most importantly, students can no longer fake their attendance credit as the student has to be physically present to send their information to the server through the TickIn application."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Connection between server and the app How to create GIFs, use various APIs.

Therefore, we are planning to design TickIn in a way such that students can also ask questions via the application.

As you practice with Stage Hand, it essentially coaches you on how to polish your speeches by keeping track of and displaying vital statistics like your average speaking speed, the main emotion that your facial expression conveys, and how many filler words you have used. We hope that making this information available in real time will allow for users to learn how to adapt while speaking in order to create the optimal speech and become a holistically better public speaker."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The Stage Hand interface was built using the React library to compose the user interface and the MediaDevices object to access our user’s video camera. The data we collect from each recording is sent to the suite of Microsoft’s Cognitive Services, utilizing the Bing Speech API’s speech-to-text function and developing our own custom language and acoustic models through the Custom Speech Service. Furthermore, various points throughout the video recording were passed into the Microsoft Emotion API, which we used to analyze the speaker’s emotional expression at any given point. Throughout the entire recording, live feedback is being given to the user so they can continue to adapt and learn the skills necessary to become excellent public speakers."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Our biggest challenge that we faced in our final rounds of debugging was that we kept getting a 403 Error when calling the Bing Speech API that was necessary for the inner speech-to-text aspect of our program. We addressed this issue with a Microsoft mentor and were able to determine that the root cause of this was on Microsoft’s end. We ended up pinging a Microsoft employee in India who had a similar issue recently, and we are awaiting a response so that we can optimize our application. In the meantime, we found a temporary workaround for this issue: we were suggested to call REST API instead of WebSocket API even though REST only works for fifteen seconds of recording. This has allowed us to create a working product that we can demo (although it is less efficient). We hope to fix this in the future upon getting a response from the employee in India. Another chief issue that we faced is that we were having a hard time recognizing filler words in the pattern of normal speech because most speech-to-text APIs automatically filter out filler words. This made it nearly impossible for us to actually be able to detect them. We were able to overcome this issue by developing custom language and acoustic models on Microsoft’s Custom Speech Service. These models allowed us to detect filler words so that we would be able to count them in our program and give feedback to the user on how to minimize the use of fillers in their speech."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are especially proud of our team’s ability to adapt to the variety of issues we had come across in the process of building the application. Every time we made a breakthrough, it seemed like we ran into a new issue. For example, when it seemed like we were almost done creating the backbone of our application, we faced issues when calling the Bing Speech API. Regardless of these challenges that were thrown at us, we were always able to overcome them in one way or another. In this sense, we are most proud of our team’s resilience."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"From this experience, we learned how to utilize and incorporate many technologies that none of us have previously used. For example, we were able to learn how to use Microsoft’s Cognitive Services in order to perform tasks like detecting emotion and converting speech to text for the internal processing of our application. Additionally, we learned how to develop custom language and acoustic models using Microsoft’s Custom Speech Service. Overall, we learned a lot from this experience when incorporating technologies into our application that were new to all of us."},{"heading":"What's next for Stage Hand","content":"Since we ran into difficulty using the Web Socket API, we had trouble opening up a tunnel from our client to the server. This bottlenecked our ability to create a live stream that directly funnels our user’s video data to the Microsoft Cognitive Services. In the future, we hope to overcome these issues to create an app that truly allows for live interactive feedback from our devices."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"google-cloud microsoft-cognitive-services microsoft-speech-services microsoft-vision-services node.js react"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"BlindSpot","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/blindspot-fxtyg7","tagline":"An elegant solution for memory and visual impairment.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/543/871/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Cal Hacks 4.0","hackathon_url":"https://calhacks4.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Use of Azure or Microsoft Tech"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"azure-custom-vision","url":null},{"name":"azure-face-detection","url":null},{"name":"ios-dev","url":null},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"mobile-dev","url":null},{"name":"neural-network","url":null},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"There are approximately 10 million Americans who suffer from visual impairment, and over 5 million Americans suffer from Alzheimer's dementia.

Using Google Graphs and Maps, we generated formulas to calculate and accurately map distances between all users as well as the distances between their respective destinations, while simultaneously displaying such information in easy-to-read graphical elements. A combined integration of Cisco Spark and Cisco Meraki, done via creation of Spark bots and information gathering with AWS Lambda, generates the heatmap for users to find their partner as well as open an avenue of communication between the two.

These quad-radio access points intercept wifi and bluetooth signals from smartphones and laptops, and we sample the data every few seconds to capture data such as unique MAC addresses, websites visited, timestamps, and duration of stay. The reason why we use MAC addresses as a primary key to identify devices and students is because each device broadcasts a unique, immutable MAC address, allowing us to track them over hours, months, and years. Additionally, by polling data every few seconds for the duration of lecture, our web app can make sure students don't leave right after signing in, which is a huge problem for many attendance methods such as using iClicker or Google Forms. Meraki keeps a constant eye on all devices in the lecture hall and allows our web app to take note as soon as a student leaves lecture."},{"heading":"The Technology","content":"We use Node-Red to interface with the access points, and stream out JSON files to a MondoDB database in the cloud.

First of all, we enhance our ability to coding in swift, especially for AR. Creating the objects in AR world teaches us the tree structure in AR, and the relationships among parent nodes and its children nodes. What's more, we get to learn swift deeper, specifically its MVC model. Last but not least, bugs teach us how to solve a problem in a team and how to minimize the probability of buggy code for next time. Most importantly, this hackathon poses the strength of teamwork."},{"heading":"What's next for DishPlay","content":"We desire to build more interactions with ARKit, including displaying a collection of dishes on 3D shelf, or cool animations that people can see how those favorite dishes were made.

This detects a suspicious person holding a gun in public and alerts the watching security. Most of the guns used for malicious intent are bought illegally, this system can also be used to tackle this scenario (avoidance scenario).\n\nSecondly, it also detects the motion of the arm before someone is about to fire a gun. The system then immediately notifies the police and the officials via email and SMS, so that they can prepare to mobilize without delay and tackle the situation accordingly.\n\nThirdly, the system recognizes the sound of a rifle/gun being fired and sounds an alarm in nearby locations to warn the people around and avoid the situation.\n\nThis system meant to aid the law enforcement to be more efficient and help people avoid such situations. This is an honest effort to use our knowledge in computer science in order to create something to make this world a better place."},{"heading":"How we built it?","content":"Our system relies on OpenCV to sample and process the real-time video stream for all machine learning components to use.\n\n1) Image Recognition/ Object Detection: This component uses the powerful Microsoft's Cognitive Services API and Azure to classify the frames. We trained the model using our custom data images. The sampled frames are classified on the cloud telling us whether is there a gun bearing human in the image with a probability distribution.\n\n2) Arm Motion recognition: The Arm Motion detection detects whether a person is about to fire a gun/rifle. It also uses the Microsoft's custom vision cognitive API to detect the position of the arms. We use an optimized algorithm on the client side to detect whether the returned probability distribution from API represents the gun firing motion.\n\n3) Sound Detection: Finally to detect the sound of a rifle/gun been fired, we use NEC's sound recognition API to detect the same. Once the program detects that the API returned true for the sound chunk, we sound an alarm to warn people.\n\nThe entire application was built in C++."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Machine learning algorithms need a lot of data for training in order to get highly accurate results.
