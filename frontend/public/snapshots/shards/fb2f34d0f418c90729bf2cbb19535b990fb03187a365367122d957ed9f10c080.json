Donations are as simple as snapping a photo with a machine vision camera that will label your food for you. The map also shows what other users around you are donating to incentivize more donations. There are also donation tips to educate users of what your community is in need of and ways to help out."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We began by creating designs for our app using Figma. At the same time, we started designing the application architecture. Once the designs were complete, we implemented the client and server in parallel. On the client-side, we used SwiftUI to create an iOS app. For the Python backend, we created the API using Flask. We used SQLAlchemy as our ORM to interact with CockroachDB."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"The biggest challenge we had to face was learning how to use SwiftUI. Although we were familiar with both Swift and React Native, we wanted to challenge ourselves to learn something new by using SwiftUI. Ultimately, this was a great decision as we were able to pick up SwiftUI and successfully complete our app.\n\nWe also ran into some issues connecting to CockroachDB and quite spent some time debugging the issue, eventually discovering that the database url provided by Cockroach Cloud was incorrect. Cockroach Cloud also went down over Saturday evening, so we had to learn how to spin up a cluster ourselves to test locally."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we’re proud of","content":"We’re really proud of the amazing designs we created for the app. We’re also really happy that we learned so many new technologies while creating this app."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"There were many new technologies we learned in the past 36 hours such as SwiftUI, CockroachDB, Google Cloud, and Facebook’s API. We also learned how to efficiently communicate and support each other virtually."},{"heading":"What's next for FridgeSpace","content":"Future Steps for our team include working with organizations such as food banks so they can make posts through the application itself. A logistical improvement could be partnering with Canada Post so that donation pickups and dropoffs could be more efficient and convenient for both the users and organizations.\n\nWe are hosting our API at fridg.space ."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"cockroachdb flask python sqlalchemy swift swiftui"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"QuaranTime","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/boredombuster-hnimzc","tagline":"We aspire to help people through the pandemic and through personal challenges by helping them discover new activities and hobbies","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/351/707/datas/medium.gif","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2020++","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2020++ Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"dart","url":null},{"name":"flutter","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flutter"},{"name":"googleapis","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/JackFrostDJ/HTN-App/tree/master"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Due to being stuck at home during Quarantine season ( for a very valid reason of course, please wear your masks ), we were in the same situation as most of the population, what should I do?

We also decided to use the Google Calendar API for the uses' convenience."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"There were many challenges that we faced. One large one included actually learning and understand how to use Flutter and Dart from the start of the Hackathon on Friday. This was a challenging experience as they were not many mentors who were experienced in this area. We also had difficulty in terms of creating a functional bottom navigation bar as there were many difficulties and not enough time.

Research has shown that while over 90% of people want to volunteer, only 1 out of 4 Americans actually do. Main barriers to volunteering include lack of time and inflexible volunteering hours.\n\nWith these pain points in mind, Helppier facilitates neighbours helping neighbours through gamified volunteering with key features including: 1) Volunteering to help people in their neighbourhood - such as grabbing groceries for their 70 year old neighbour, or walking their neighbour’s dog 2) Requesting for help based on location - a streamlined place to send requests for volunteers 3) Earning rewards using the web-app’s cryptocurrency, Karma Coins, to redeem gift cards and donations for charity"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"In order to build a decentralized network where we can have our own cryptocurrency, and used Microsoft Azure which provides a blockchain service. We used Solidity to create and deploy our smart contract and called our coin “Karma Coin”. Karma Coin is built upon the ERC-20 token standard. To interact with our network, we used web3 and created a Restful API using Express which provides methods to perform a transfer of Karma Coin as well as retrieve the balance for a given user. This Restful API is used by our backend infrastructure which is built using Python, Flask and CockroachDB. All this information is retrieved through API calls made by the frontend which was built using React and designed on Figma."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"While the developers of the team have experience with Python, React and databases like MongoDB, this was the first time they had contact with the blockchain and CockroachDB. Amine spent some time to familiarise himself on Saturday with how the blockchain worked and how he could create a cryptocurrency for our app, especially given that we had no prior experience in the domain. At first, he struggled to understand how he could create wallets and whether he needed to use a Microsoft Azure API to create and add new members to the consortium. However, he later realised through the use of the Chrome extension Metamask, that it wasn’t necessary. He looked at potentially using the Metamask API to interact with his deployed network, however, he found out about web3 and learned how to use it with Javascript. Meanwhile, Tele spent some time learning how to use CockroachDB and struggled to efficiently process geographical coordinates in the database until he found out about Geoalchemy, an extension to work with spatial data. Finally, as the frontend development was led by James, he had a lot of flows to implement from the wireframes and prototypes made by Janice the UX designer."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are extremely proud to have been able to deploy our own cryptocurrency in the short time span we had.

Typically-used splint and cast materials are often quite heavy, lack water resistance, lack airflow, and a few other drawbacks. However, when searching through the 3D printing forums, a talented few constructed their own 3D printed casts. On the other hand of the talented few, there was little efficiency when attempting to scan one's arm, leg, etc… The most common method of scanning was photogrammetry using cameras. Most cameras used in these situations capture little to no depth and the process would take hours to perform without the right equipment. With the rise of LiDAR sensors, one common theme took hold, which was that of scanning objects. LiDAR has become very accessible at low costs. Taking into account all the factors listed, it seemed like the perfect opportunity to make an MRI-like machine that scans a patient's arm."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"The CAST3D machine begins with the Alexa interaction, where the user data and information is collected. Once greeted, the machine takes a complete scan of the user’s injured arm and sends it to a technician's device. From there, the captured scan is processed to smooth down any discrepancies and to create the printable cast. Once done, the user has a printer-ready tailored 3D model to their distinct arm"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We first built an Alexa skill using voiceflow, that takes in new patient’s information, as well as updating a recurring patient's information. The skill collects the patient's first name, last name, email address, and phone number, this information then gets written into a google sheet that stores as well as dynamically updates this information. A google sheet script was made by coding in javascript which allowed for all of the email addresses that Alexa retrieves to be correctly formatted to emailaddress@mail.com . We then used the API blocks to connect to the Blynk server which turns on/off a virtual pin that connects to the NodeMCU via WiFi, the NodeMCU then sends a signal to the Arduino to turn on/off the relay which then tells the motors to move counter-clockwise until the scan is complete (1.52 mins). Once the scan is complete two more API integration blocks were used to allow voiceflow to connect to the Blynk server which turns on/off another virtual pin which is connected to the NodeMCU via WiFi, the NodeMCU then sends a signal to the Arduino to turn on/off the relay which then tells the motors to move clockwise back to their original position ready for another scan."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We are into many different challenges both hardware and software. Software Issues: We initially had issues with the NodeMCU connecting to the Blynk server, we eventually just reset the board and it then worked. Many issues arose with voiceflow, we keep receiving errors for certain variables. Another issue with voiceflow was updating data for re-occurring patients. Hardware Issues: One of the first issues we came across was correctly sizing the belt for both wheels, even when we correctly measured the size for the belt, once the rotating arm reached the bottom too much slack within the belt occurred which did not allow for the rotation to continue. Another hardware issue that occurred was getting the NodeMCU board to communicate to the Arduino."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"It worked! After several hardware and software mishaps, we got the machine to operate smoothly enough to capture a clean arm scan."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Making a system that combines hardware, software, and the interface can be quite challenging. Although it is always the hope that things work from the get-go. However, that was far from true. Troubleshooting on all levels of the system had to be completed on several occasions to better our device’s performance. Additionally, we learned to cooperate more as a team than as individuals. Both of us brought good ideas to the discussion table and a sense of individuality. On the other hand, we performed greatest when we combined those ideas and improved upon them."},{"heading":"What's next for CAST3D - Scanner for Medicinal Casts","content":"Hopefully, sometime in the future, a CAST3D V2 comes about. Several design aspects need to be reconsidered for this device to be feasible for use in institutions. For example, opting for a more rigid material such as metal would have been a better option. Additionally, now that there is a better understanding of the hardware used, the goal is to prevent the time it requires to troubleshoot."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino google-spreadsheets javascript nodemcu voiceflow"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Jump!","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/jump-ar5890","tagline":"A competitive multiplayer exercise game that makes it fun and easy to stay fit with friends through the internet.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/001/349/730/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"Hack the North 2020++","hackathon_url":"https://hackthenorth2020.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Hack the North 2020++ Finalists"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"gcp","url":null},{"name":"ios","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ios"},{"name":"posenet","url":null},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"swiftui","url":null},{"name":"vonage","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/yashmulki/htnapp"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/LunarCoffee/Jump"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Since the start of 2020, it's become increasingly difficult to get into shape. Gyms around the world have been closing, and a higher degree of social isolation has made it hard to stay motivated to keep fit. Unfortunately, if you're forced to stay home, it can be tough to stay on track with your fitness schedule, get feedback from friends and trainers, maintain proper form during exercises, and have fun while exercising! Recognizing that exercise is much more engaging when you do it with friends, we decided to create a fun multiplayer exercise experience, called Jump!."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We've built a real-time multiplayer competitive exercise game powered by computer vision where you compete by staying healthy. Two users can compete with each other to complete a sequence of exercises (ex. push ups, squats, etc.) via a live link, and our app detects their current pose and analyzes this data to determine when they have correctly completed the exercise. Think Just Dance, but with exercise and you don't need to be in the same room."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The iOS app was built with Swift, primarily using the SwiftUI framework to create our views, animations, and menus. We made extensive use of the Vision framework to apply the PoseNet pose estimation model to track the users' movement in realtime with six degrees of freedom. This data was used to track when users performed the correct exercise move (ex. a push-up). The Vonage API was used to create a video/audio link to the other player, which enabled users to work out together online in realtime as well as to store recordings of the exercise section.\n\nWe also built a backend with Python and Flask that we hosted on Google Cloud. Google Cloud allowed us to use continuous deployment for a seamless development workflow and provided fast and reliable hosting. The primary purpose the backend served was to coordinate running games and synchronize the current game state with the phones in real-time, and to allow the phones to communicate with each other. The Vonage API was used extensively here as well, in Vonage session management for the frontend, game state sharing through the signal API, and video/audio archiving for each exercise game, allowing users to rewatch and analyze their past matches."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Building a real-time, online multiplayer component: due to the large amount of information we needed to quickly communicate between the two devices, it was a significant challenge to coordinate the video calls from the backend, and then connect both iOS apps to a single connection, while also recording the stream and transferring state information about scores and exercises between the two devices. This necessitated a lot of work with websockets to enable the constant stream of communication that was necessary.\n\nOptimizing performance while running both a video call stream and pose estimation/tracking: It took a significant amount of effort to get both running simultaneously in an efficient manner. We had to dig deep into iOS's AVFoundation API to enable non-standard functionality that was necessary for our use case. Furthermore, we also delved into the Vonage API's extensibility as we had to implement some protocols with custom implementation to have both our computer vision pipeline and our video calls work off the same video capture session."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"UI Design and Tactile Feedback: We spent a significant amount of time designing and then refining our user interface, incorporating haptic feedback, sound and a slate of animations to create the best possible user experience. We also implemented special effects during exercise routines using particle systems to create confetti when a user finished a stage of the routine.\n\nExercise Motion Detection: To enable our core feature of detecting users' exercise movements, we built a highly extensible system that enables the rapid definition of any exercise movements by specifying the angles and relative distances between key joints on a users' body. This enabled us to transfer the work done on enabling one exercise movement to many others, and makes the system far more generally applicable."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Computer Vision: We learned how to effectively apply PoseNet, a computer vision model for six degrees of freedom (6DOF) body pose tracking to track the users' movements during their exercise routine. This was the first time we'd worked with real-time computer vision inference, so it was an interesting experience to work on optimizing performance, visualizations and more.\n\nReactive + Declarative Programming: We used SwiftUI, a reactive and declarative framework for building user interfaces based on application state. For some of us, this was the first time we'd worked with SwiftUI (and iOS development in general) so it was a great learning opportunity that helped us expand our skillsets.\n\nVideo Calling: While we'd worked with video in apps before, this was the first time we used a live 2-way stream to enable video chat between two users. Thankfully, the Vonage API helped us enable a high fidelity stream, and we had the opportunity to go in depth with the AVFoundation API to capture and display these streams.\n\nCI/CD: We decided to take advantage of Google Cloud's CI/CD tools with our backend to allow us to constantly have the latest version of the backend deployed whenever the code was pushed to GitHub. This significantly accelerated our development workflow and helped us iterate rapidly."},{"heading":"What's next for Jump!","content":"We've envisioned a couple of improvements for the app that we think can further improve the experience.

We are regularly reminded to make informed decisions and hold ourselves accountable, but when it comes to actual policy, even some of the most socially active individuals know close to nothing.\n\nWhy are so many people poorly informed about the actual policies that shape our lives? For starters, policy is often extremely inaccessible. To those who are unfamiliar with how policies are developed, it is difficult to determine where to find necessary documents and reports. Even with the correct readings in hand, the average person would likely not want to read through page after page of dense language to understand a policy.\n\nHow can we truly understand our place in society without understanding the policies that shape it? In order to understand these policies, how can we overcome the boring and inaccessible ways in which policies are currently presented?

Players will need to plan ahead of time to consider how their present actions assist their future goals when being replayed concurrently, or how a future action might allow the present player to reach an objective.\n\nTo make this even more challenging, we have added built-in enemies that will speed up toward the player when the enemy sees the player, to stop them from finishing their puzzles. Players can shoot bullets in the direction of the cursor to kill enemies or push other copies of the player (sometimes necessary to push the player onto an objective).\n\nLast but not least, we have implemented dynamic terrain such that players can open gates or move platforms to reach previously inaccessible places through interacting with the world (buttons/pressure plates, etc.), and different objectives the player should reach to increase the score and beat the level."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Although we have never used Ubisoft’s game engine API, we wanted to challenge ourselves to learn more about game dev and really put our teamwork and technical skills to the test under stress.

It processes the video by downloading it from the link, unzipping it if necessary, and extracting the newest action before passing it to the computer vision model.\n\nThe computer vision pose detection algorithm is built using Tensorflow and OpenCV in Python, alongside the Posenet dataset to establish the key points of the body.

Friends and family are just pixels on a screen.... we are alone. But what if that weren't the case? What if we could flip the script and enjoy each other's company without being in each other's company?\n\nThe answer is Karaoke Party . We took the classic karaoke experience and brought it to our times. Through song and melody we will heal, we will come together and make it through."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Karaoke Party is a web application for friends looking to sing today's greatest hits. The process is incredibly simple. Once you launch Karaoke Party, you can create/join a room and invite your friends. Then choose a song of your choice. This is where the fun begins. When you're ready, hit play. The lyrics will start rolling down the screen and you can start singing! Our audio comparison algorithim will compare your beautiful voice to the actual audio of the song and assign points based on how close you were in real time. By the end of the song all your points will be finalized. Now, finally , you will be able to tell once and for all who amongst your friends has the voice of an angel!"},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Audio Similarity and Scoring Algorithm\n\nFor every song in our playlist, we’ve used an lrc file to dynamically slice the song into its primary bars that players will sing in rotation. Karaoke party records each bar sung by a participant and sends it to our server, where it’s converted into a WAV file and compared with the same clip but sung by the song’s original singer. We extract the pitches from the audio files using the Yin algorithm and map pitches at individual frames to musical notes. The similarity of the notes over the duration of the entire clip determines the player’s score for that particular bar and once a score is determined, it is sent to all clients through websockets to ensure everybody knows who's in the lead at all times.\n\nFrontend\n\nKaraoke Party is built on an unique architecture to give our users the best karaoke experience. Our front end is built with React which allows us to offer a unique modern UI design combined with images to stay connected with your favorite singers. The video chat capability of the app is built in Agora.io. Agora.io dealt with a large portion of the boiler plate; things like video routing, rooms, and dynamic displays — which when we combined with web sockets, helped us create an engaging, real-time experience."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We ran into and overcame many challenges while building Karaoke Party. First and foremost, Socket.io. Our use of Socket.io was unique. A flask server with a react front-end is an atypical structure, There wasn't much in the way of documentation and tutorials for this specific configuration of sockets. This translated into having dig deep into the documentation for flask-socketIO, having only with a variety of obscure medium articles to guide us as well. We made it through and it was incredibly rewarding. Another significant issue we faced was syncing the lrc slices to the user's audio, we were consistently off by one line. Despite our lack of sleep, we were able to solve the issue by simply indexing the slices, so as to match audio chunks with their corresponding line in the song. It worked beautifully and we're so happy it worked out the way it did."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Not to brag or anything, but we killed it with the audio similarity and scoring algorithm. At first the task of audio comparisons seemed daunting . How do you deal with the delay? How do you isolate the voice from the instrumental? Once we found out about lrc files for music, we began to put the pieces together, it all sort of clicked. Our delegation of tasks was also something to proud of too. We all handled our own assigned parts masterfully and we couldn't be more proud of the final result. ."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Our team learned how to use a react front end with a flask/python backend server which was a really interesting challenge. also, we learned a lot more about CORS issues because we had to deal with a lot of those!

Python to create the customization software. Used OpenCV, Tkinter and Pynput libraries.\n\nHow does Tabular work?\n\nWe first created a wireless camera module with Raspberry Pi Zero W that takes frames. These frames are then sent to the computer wirelessly. the frames are then scanned for faces. If a known face is detected then the customization software performs a preset keystroke.\n\nThe customization software allows users to add faces and change the keybind.\n\nTechnical Difficulties\n\nOur Raspberry Pi had limited computing power and memory, which affected both our ability to process faces and our ability to install large Python libraries. We ended up streaming the video to a server to process it on a more powerful machine. The famous alt-tab keybind (aka the namesake of Tabular) did not work with our code. After a bit of troubleshooting, we were able to get it working.\n\nUse Cases\n\nNever let your parents catch you playing video games again!

The input parameters include their age, sex, and prior medical conditions, and the output is death/recovery. This is used to train a logistic regression model that is ultimately able to take in the parameters of any individual and output the probability of death due to COVID.

The estimates are based on official guidelines and data provided by national and provincial governments. We adjust the datasets to improve the estimates based on changes that affect the rollout plan. A vaccine map for the user to gain insights into the rollout plan such as the number of doses that have been administered in different provinces. Relevant Covid-19 alerts are sent to you via web notifications, e-mails or SMS messages. A convenient locator to find the vaccination centres near you to make an appointment when it becomes available to you. An easy-to-use scheduler for you to set a reminder for your appointment to receive the two doses of vaccine."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We built the web application with responsive design using Angular and Material Design guidelines. We used IBM’s award-winning LoopBack 4 framework to quickly scaffold our REST API server. The Angular front-end calls this backend API server through OpenAPI 3.0 standards. Using DropBase’s simple-to-use API, we efficiently processed a large amount of web scraped data and loaded them quickly into our database for our live insights. We used CockroachDB as our database, which was fast to deploy but very robust on GCP and load balanced using HAProxy to yield the benefits of Distributed SQL. We sent instant SMS alerts using the Vonage API, which is a powerful tool to implement SMS messaging in web applications. We sent push notifications to the users using Google’s streamlined Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) API, which is robust and easy to use. We used IBM Cloud to deploy and host the server components of the application. We were able to package both our client web application built with Angular and REST API server using IBM’s LoopBack 4 Framework into Docker images and stored them in the IBM Cloud private container registry. We then successfully deployed these images into Kubernetes.\n\nArchitecture\n\nDeployment\n\nDropbase"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We struggled to quickly learn the APIs in order to integrate them into our application.

In making this decision, we consulted our favourite and least favourite apps to gain an understanding of what our final product could eventually look like. In the end, we came to a consensus to prioritize making the app accessible to all individuals. For this reason, we decided to make two different games: the infamous flappy bird and the classic Google Chrome dino game. By first integrating two very well known games, we were able to make the learning curve for our UI as shallow as possible. Another very important challenge we ran into was the limitations of our physical strength. Our quads were sore; arms were heavy.

For example, we would like to add the functionality to work out with people outside of your friend’s list and create the opportunity to make new connections. This would allow us to bring more people together and help foster connections with interesting people around the world.\n\nAnother example is we would like to build a feature that can detect movement and count the number of times you complete an exercise which is the Pose Estimation. This could be used as an interesting feature in which users can challenge each other to achieve the highest number of push ups in 60 seconds or hold the longest plank or any other exercise. We would also like to flesh out the IBM NLU API integration, adding features to dynamically adjust workout plans based on detected user sentiment patterns.\n\nImagine yourself with Fitmotiv:\n\nNo more sedentary lifestyle.
