However, current centalized video content production platforms (like YouTube, Udemy, etc.) take too much profits from the content producers (resaech have shown that content creators usually only receive 15% of the values their contents create) and the values generated from the video are not distributed in a timely manner. In order to tackle this unfair value distribution, we have this decentralized platform EDU.IO where the video contents will be backed by their digital assets as an NFT (copyright protection!) and fractionalized as tokens, and it creates direct connections between content creators and viewers/fans (no middlemen anymore!), maximizing the value of the contents made by creators."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"EDU.IO is a decentralized educational video streaming media platform & fractionalized NFT exchange that empowers creator economy and redefines knowledge value distribution via smart contracts.\n\nAs an educational hub, EDU.IO is a decentralized platform of high-quality educational videos on disruptive innovations and hot topics like metaverse, 5G, IoT, etc. As a booster of creator economy, once a creator uploads a video (or course series), it will be mint as an NFT (with copyright protection) and fractionalizes to multiple tokens. Our platform will conduct a mini-IPO for the each content they produced - bid for fractionalized NFTs. The value of each video token is determined by the number of views over a certain time interval, and token owners (can be both creators and viewers/fans/investors) can advertise the contents they owned to increase it values, and trade these tokens to earn monkey or make other investments (more liquidity!!). By the end of the week, the value generated by each video NFT will be distributed via smart contracts to the copyright / fractionalized NFT owners of each video. Overall we’re hoping to build an ecosystem with more engagement between viewers and content creators, and our three main target users are: 1. Instructors or Content creators: where the video contents can get copyright protection via NFT, and they can get fairer value distribution and more liquidity compare to using large centralized platforms 2. Fans or Content viewers: where they can directly interact and support content creators, and the fee will be sent directly to the copyright owners via smart contract. 3. Investors: Lower barrier of investment, where everyone can only to a fragment of a content. People can also to bid or trading as a secondary market."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Frontend in HTML, CSS, SCSS, Less, React.JS Backend in Express.JS, Node.JS ELUV.IO for minting video NFTs (eth-based) and for playing quick streaming videos with high quality & low latency CockroachDB (a distributed SQL DB) for storing structured user information (name, email, account, password, transactions, balance, etc.) IPFS & Filecoin (distributed protocol & data storage) for storing video/course previews (decentralization & anti-censorship)"},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Transition from design to code CockroachDB has an extensive & complicated setup, which requires other extensions and stacks (like Docker) during the set up phase which caused a lot of problems locally on different computers.

Your unique settings and friends list are tied to the account that you register and log in with."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Using React Native and JavaScript, Bump! is built for both IOS and Android. For the Backend, we used MongoDB and Node.js. The project consisted of four major and distinct components.\n\nGeolocation Map For our geolocation map, we used the expo's geolocation library, which allowed us to cross-match the positional data of all the user's friends.\n\nUser Authentication The user authentication proceeds was built using additional packages such as Passport.js, Jotai, and Bcrypt.js. Essentially, we wanted to store new users through registration and verify old users through login by searching them up in MongoDB, hashing and salting their password for registration using Bcrypt.js, and comparing their password hash to the existing hash in the database for login. We also used Passport.js to create Json Web Tokens, and Jotai to store user ID data globally in the front end.\n\nRouting and Web Sockets To keep track of user location data, friend lists, conversation logs, and notifications, we used MongoDB as our database and a node.js backend to save and access data from the database. While this worked for the majority of our use cases, using HTTP protocols for instant messaging proved to be too slow and clunky so we made the design choice to include WebSockets for client-client communication. Our architecture involved using the server as a WebSocket host that would receive all client communication but would filter messages so they would only be delivered to the intended recipient.\n\nNavigation and User Interface : For our UI, we wanted to focus on simplicity, cleanliness, and neutral aesthetics. After all, we felt that the Bump! the experience was really about the time spent with friends rather than on the app, so designed the UX such that Bump! is really easy to use."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"To begin, package management and setup were fairly challenging. Since we've never done mobile development before, having to learn how to debug, structure, and develop our code was definitely tedious. In our project, we initially programmed our frontend and backend completely separately; integrating them both and working out the moving parts was really difficult and required everyone to teach each other how their part worked.\n\nWhen building the instant messaging feature, we ran into several design hurdles; HTTP requests are only half-duplex, as they are designed with client initiation in mind. Thus, there is no elegant method for server-initiated client communication. Another challenge was that the server needed to act as the host for all WebSocket communication, resulting in the need to selectively filter and send received messages."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We're particularly proud of Bump! because we came in with limited or no mobile app development experience (in fact, this was the first hackathon for half the team). This project was definitely a huge learning experience for us; not only did we have to grind through tutorials, youtube videos, and a Stack Overflowing of tears, we also had to learn how to efficiently work together as a team. Moreover, we're also proud that we were not only able to build something that would make a positive impact in theory but a platform that we see ourselves actually using on a day-to-day basis. Lastly, despite setbacks and complications, we're super happy that we developed an end product that resembled our initial design."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"In this project, we really had an opportunity to dive headfirst in mobile app development; specifically, learning all about React Native, JavaScript, and the unique challenges of implementing backend on mobile devices.

As college students who don't necessarily have the monetary means to eat out, we are forced to eat whatever the dining hall throws us, whether that be uncooked pork, salads infested with E. coli, or salmonella-infested chicken. Often, we leave the dining hall with empty stomachs and demoralized state of mind. Furthermore, students currently have to message all social media in order to find a friend to eat, which creates significant friction in coordinating meals. Lastly, CalDining's improvements feel slow and inefficient with changes often feeling highly undemocratic."},{"heading":"Target Market","content":"Our primary target market is students at university. Students are the main users of our application because students eat at the dining hall on a large-scale basis daily. Our secondary target market is the university itself because universities will benefit greatly from the democratized access to information on our platform in order to improve their meal selection, waste management, and business model."},{"heading":"Solution","content":"DineRight has four key features to improve this experience for college students and university dining-hall management.\n\nWe enable real-time reviews of dining hall food . Each meal, students have multiple dining halls, and thus food options, to choose from. Currently, students will explore Cal Dining's online menu to help them decide which cafeteria to dine at. However, this method lacks democratization and information density than other applications like Yelp have. To solve this issue, DineRight imports the dining hall options and nutrition information for every meal each day and allows students to rate each of the items served at all dining halls in real-time. Other students can see these reviews live to advise their dining-hall decision. The fish tacos were a bit overcooked at Berkeley's Crossroads? We now know to avoid Crossroads (or at least avoid the tacos)! Searching through dining hall reviews before every meal is tedious, especially on an empty stomach. We have a solution. After you review your first few meals, we use machine learning (specifically clustering algorithms) in order to recommend the best dining hall for you at the current time, given the food being served and reviews . More technically, if students who have similar tastes to you are enjoying a particular dining hall or food item, we infer that you have a higher probability of also enjoying the food and will recommend it. We will send you a notification along the lines of \"We think you might like Cafe 3's Pesto Pasta with Sun-Dried Tomatoes.\" Your input on our recommendations will further improve the algorithm for everyone. Finally, most students prefer to eat at the dining hall with a few friends. However, finding a group for three meals a day can be difficult given the student's busyness. We will thus notify you when your friends attend dining halls, so you can join them! Get ready to receive notifications like \"Hungry right now? Join Arjun, Tony, and Chris are at Clark Kerr dining hall!\" This information can also be viewed by opening the app. This data is a treasure chest for dining halls, so we built a dining hall management portal, in addition. The portal allows dining halls to receive actionable feedback about their food. For example, Crossroads' reviews might indicate that Pork Lasanga was perfect, but a bit too salty; they can fix this for next time. Without DineRight, Crossroads' would just see the lasagna piling up in their compost bins, but not understand the cause. This will significantly reduce dining hall food waste and encourage dining halls to focus on quality."},{"heading":"Competitive Growth Plan","content":"Continuous R&D and Technical Strength: We plan to continue building our application with several key new features after the hackathon such as a DineRight Climate Score and DineRight Nutrition Score such that students are able to dine more consciously and holistically. Furthermore, some competitive elements we may add are Dining Hall wars or scavenger hunts in the dining halls in order to improve the social features in the dining hall. Distribution and Marketing: We plan to distribute this application in both the App Store and the Google Play store for students to utilize. Furthermore, we plan to deploy our web app online for administrators to be able to take advantage of the system, similar to existing Berkeley applications like BerkeleyTime. In doing so, we plan to make a strategic partnership with CalDining as a starting point, which will provide us with the monetization necessary to scale. Afterward, we will apply our business model to other universities in hopes of viral growth and improvement in food quality. First Mover Advantage: As first movers in the archaic domain of CalDining, we are able to capitalize on the existing market share and take advantage of the opportunities that currently exist. As we rapidly iterate and test our products at Berkeley and beyond, we hope to set the dominant design in the market."},{"heading":"Technologies","content":"Frontend: Used the JavaScript framework Vue.js to streamline the development of our multi-page and multi-page component application. We also used Vuetify as a component library to incorporate material design into our user interface. Our application is a Progressive Web-App that is responsive based on the size of the screen, from phones to computer screens to suit the users' needs no matter what device they are using our web app on.\n\nNatural Language Processing: We are actively working on and improving a natural language processing algorithm that powers the dining hall and food recommendation system. It is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that utilizes the TfIdfVectorizer with N-grams and K-means clustering in order to identify unique student subgroups in cuisine and restaurant preference. Digging deeper into the specifics, the TfIdfVectorizer converts the qualitative content from user comments and reviews and quantifies it in a manner such that we are able to identify words that probabilistically appear the most and least together. We believe that TfIdfVectorizer will be more effective in comparison to a more naive CountVectorizer approach because the TfIdfVectorizer accounts for the word distribution across documents.\n\nComputer Vision: We are also actively working on and improving a computer vision deep-learning algorithm. Because of the time constraints in this hackathon, we utilized an off-the-shelf pre-trained VGG Neural Network Architecture in order to detect foods in images and label them. We chose the VGG Net because it has proven itself in object detection for large-scale images. To improve the transfer learning process to adapt more to CalDining specific foods, we are adding several layers beyond the current VGG Neural Network Architecture in order to better characterize these foods specifically. As we are able to build our own dataset of CalDining food, we will continuously train these algorithms. This computer vision algorithm will make the entire commenting and review process more seamless because it reduces the time spent tagging images.\n\nCockroachDB: Our Node.js backend connects to our CockroachDB which is running in CockroachDB Cloud on Google Cloud. We mainly rely on CockroachDB as our relational database of choice due to its focus on scalability and parallelism (thought of as a drop-in replacement for Google Spanner).\n\n*Due to time constraints, some of these features/concepts are not fully functioning/implemented in our current prototype.

Both sitting in a chair and slouching in bed cause me to crane my neck, which is not good for my posture.\n\nAs I was lying there in pain, I wished I had a way to just have the computer screen right above my face, while keeping the keyboard on my lap, so I could keep my spine fully straight when using the computer. I knew I could do this with a VR headset like the Oculus Rift, but those are expensive — around $400.\n\nBut what if I could use my phone as the VR headset? Since I already own it, the only cost is the VR headset holder. Google Cardboard costs around $5, and a more comfortable one that I purchased off Amazon was only $20.

Students looking for houses often have to hire some agent to get a nice place with a decent landlord. The same goes for house owners who need to hire agents to get good tenants. The irony is that the agent is totally motivated by sheer commission and not by the wellbeing of any of the above two.\n\nLack of communication is another issue as most of the things are conveyed by a middle person. It often leads to miscommunication between the house owner and the tenant, as they interpret the same rent agreement differently.\n\nExpensive and time-consuming background checks of potential tenants are also prevalent, as landowners try to use every tool at their disposal to know if the person is really capable of paying rent on time, etc. Considering that current rent laws give tenants considerable power, it's very reasonable for landlords to perform background checks!\n\nExisting online platforms can help us know which apartments are vacant in a locality, but they don't help either party know if the other person is really good! Their ranking algorithms aren't trustable with tenants. The landlords are also reluctant to use these services as they need to manually review applications from thousands of unverified individuals or even bots!\n\nWe observed that we are still using these old-age non-scalable methods to match the home seeker and homeowners willing to rent their place in this digital world!

In this way, clean tenants and honest landlords can meet each other.\n\nThis platform also helps the two stakeholders build an easily understandable contract that will establish better trust and mutual harmony. The contract is stored on an InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and cannot be tampered by anyone.\n\nOur application also has an end-to-end encrypted chatting module powered by @ Company.

We used Firebase functions to build scalable serverless functions and used expressjs as a framework for convenience. Things were working fine locally, but our middleware functions like multer, urlencoder, and jsonencoder weren't working on the server. It took us more than 4 hours to know that \"Firebase performs a lot of implicit parsing\", and before these middleware functions get the data, Firebase already had removed them.

Customers today can’t trust that companies won’t store or use their data maliciously, nor can they trust data communication channels. However, many companies need access to user data to offer extensive proprietary analyses. This results in seemingly clashing objectives: how can we get access to state-of-the-art proprietary models without having to fork over our data to companies?\n\nWhat if we can have our cake and eat it too?"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"We use end-to-end encryption offered by The @ Company to encrypt user data and include a digital signature before we send it over an insecure communication channel. Using public-key cryptography, the server can verify the digital signature and decrypt user data after receiving it. This prevents any malicious third party from accessing the data through exploiting communications between IoT devices.\n\nIn order to prevent companies from having access to user data, we use a method known as Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to perform operations on encrypted user data without needing to decrypt it first. Therefore, we encrypt data on the user-side, send over the encrypted data to the server, the server performs operations on the encrypted data without decrypting it, then sends the result in ciphertext back to the user. Thus, we achieve access to state-of-the-art models saved on cloud servers without having to give up user data in plaintext to potentially untrustworthy companies."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"We used Flutter as our frontend, and trained two different machine learning algorithms in the backend. From our frontend, we encrypt our user data with FHE, and send it over an encrypted channel using services provided by The @ Company. Our backend runs a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) over the encrypted data without decrypting it, and sends the encrypted result back. Finally, the application decrypts the result, and displays it to the user."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Currently, existing FHE schemes can only provide linear operators. However, nonlinearities are crucial to implementing any sort of convolutional neural networks (CNN’s). After doing some research , we initially decided to use polynomial approximations of nonlinear functions, but at the cost of greatly increasing inference error (on CIFAR-10, the approximation models produced an accuracy of 77.5% vs. ~95% on state-of-the-art models).\n\nAgain, can we have our cake and eat it too? Yes we can! We employ a scheme inspired by the latest FHE research that compresses high-resolution images and leverages Taylor series expansion of smooth ReLU with novel min-max normalization to bound error to approximately 3% off state-of-the-art, with cleverly formulated low-rank approximations.\n\nThis scheme solves the dual problem of heavily reducing communication overhead in other FHE schemes when faced with number of pixels growing quadratically as edge length increases."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Not only did we get a demo up and running in a day, we also learned encryption algorithms from scratch and was able to implement it in our project idea. In addition to the technical application details that we had to implement, we also had to read different research papers, test out different models and algorithms, and integrate them into our project."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Homomorphic Functions\n\nHomomorphic functions are a structure-preserving map between two algebraic structures of the same type. This means that given a function on the plaintext space, we can find a function on the encrypted ciphertext space that would result in the same respective outputs. For example, if we are given two messages m1 and m2, then homomorphism in addition states that encrypting m1 and m2 and then adding them together is the same as encrypting the sum of m1 and m2.\n\nFully Homomorphic Encryption\n\nFully homomorphic encryption uses homomorphic functions to ensure that data is stored in a trustworthy space. The user first encrypts their data, sends the encrypted data to a server, then the server performs computations on the encrypted data using homomorphic functions, and sends the result back to the user. Once decrypted by the user, the user will have their desired result. The benefits of FHE is that there is no need for trusted third parties to get proprietary data analysis. The user doesn’t have to trust the server with their data to get their results. In addition, it eliminates the tradeoff between data usability and privacy, as there is no need to mask or drop any features to preserve data privacy."},{"heading":"What's next for CypherAI","content":"In our project, we demonstrated two use cases for our product in different company settles: home monitoring for security cameras, and healthcare systems.

The Academic Senate defines one unit as three hours of work per week. Therefore, most major requirement courses are of 3 or 4 units, equivalent to 9 or 12 hours per week. However, almost every Berkeley student knows that this is usually an underestimate. Alumni and even the professors admit that most courses take way more time to do well in it than what is implied in unit values. Popular classes such as CS 61A even draw criticism due to students end up spending more than 12 hours per week to complete the required lectures, homework, labs, projects, and exam practice. We don't think there is anything wrong with making a course demanding, but a lack of information on how much time is really needed hinders students' ability to make informed decisions on what classes to take. Right now, students usually rely on words to gauge a class' workload: they will ask their friends and upperclassmen who have taken the course. This approach is not perfect, however, because each people may perceive difficulty a bit differently and sometimes it's hard to find someone who has actually taken the class. Therefore, we decide to create a RateMyProfessor-style website so that students can rate and view courses' workload information in one stop."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"CalRate is a platform that can enable students to rate a course's real workload and time commitment based on their personal experience during the semester.

This will give us valuable feedback and allow us to further polish the UI and functionalities. This will also generate initial data so that when it is online for all students to use, they will already find it useful. In the long run, we also hope to integrate this with another functionality: sharing course resources. Some classes have instructor-provided extra resources - notes, Youtube videos, books, to help those students that find course materials insufficient, but many others don't. We want to build a platform that allows students that have taken the course to take the lead and share resources they find helpful.

Future versions of the app will implement in-house chat and file-upload features using E2E encryption from The @ Company.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nWhen users download Roomie from the iOs and Android app store, they'll be asked to create a profile with more information about themselves as well as select their housing & roommate preferences: location, price range, number of roommates, sleep schedule, major at UC Berkeley, and more! B\n\nBehind the scenes, Roomie will take in a user's preferences and their associated weightings and allow the user to swipe left and right on Roomies that are closely aligned to that user's preferences. Our algorithm ensures that users will only see Roomies with similar preferences and that users will only connect with Roomies with whom they find themselves interested in living with at UC Berkeley! This adds another layer of security when it comes to finding the right Roomie.\n\nChallenges with implementation\n\nNeither Alex nor Will had any experience in programming language Swift, so learning the language in such a short window of time made for some stressful nights and early mornings. As opposed to working solely on the iOs application, Will set out to develop the website to display the app while Alex worked on writing Swift code, building the user interface, and bringing our ideas to life"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are proud to have made a functioning website with animation that will hopefully bring attention to our project for the future. We are also proud to have creating a sample iPhone application that gives us confidence in our ability to fully implement our application over time as we learn more backend/frontend development. We were also able to think up a matching algorithm that we truly believe will make the best matches possible for all of our users.\n\nLessons for the future\n\nWe realize that our idea is one to keep, and we intend on pursuing the full development of an iOs and android app with a beautiful user interface by Fall 2022. For now, this app will be exclusive to UC Berkeley students. To expand to your University, please contact either Will or Alex."},{"heading":"What's next for Roomie","content":"We have a lot more planning and fine-tuning to do before we start to learn the nitty gritty about Xcode and iOS development. Once we iron out our idea, create more prototype apps in Figma, and deploy our algorithm in javascript to test on sample inputs, we will start to build the app in Swift and have our friends try it out before we launch it on the App Store."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"css figma html javascript photoshop swift"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"www.willtholke.com www.figma.com github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:44:49.369141Z"}}
