However, it can be time-consuming and tedious to manually go through every course instance to find all the upcoming assignments, which has resulted in us missing deadlines. To solve this problem, we wanted to create a tool that would easily display upcoming assignments and add them to our Google Calendar, so that we could get notifications."},{"heading":"What it Does","content":"Our program parses all the relevant course data on the user's PrairieLearn homepage, and then sorts it by the most recent deadlines. Then we add sub-sections to each course instance in the homepage displaying the upcoming assignments in a clickable view that redirects them to the given assignment. Additionally, you can export your assignments to Google Calendar such that all assignment instances that exist get added to PrairieLearn.\n\nWe built the tool mostly using the Beautiful Soup and Selenium libraries. Parsing the data was done by reading and inspecting a lot of the elements since the data is all rendered client-side. We faced some challenges while parsing the data since the structure of loading all the elements into Python was not straightforward, and the Beautiful Soup docs were not that helpful. However, we were able to figure it out by working together as a team and experimenting with different approaches.\n\nAdding elements, and especially the deadline course instances to the home page was really challenging since we were building it using Python, and the code was not robust enough to add a JavaScript environment to it. Therefore, we had to code the JavaScript using Python scripting and string insertions. This was a very time-consuming process, but it helped us to understand how the front-end and back-end interact with each other.\n\nWorking with the Google Calendar API proved to be non-trivial, and we faced a lot of issues by integrating the PrairieLearn data into a large-scale object that can be created into calendar event instances. However, we were able to overcome these issues by working collaboratively and breaking down the problem into smaller sub-problems."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We are extremely proud of our teamwork and how well we were able to delegate tasks based on each member's interests. When we first got all the data in a representable object, and being able to push events to the calendar using the data was an incredible breakthrough moment for the group that we all enjoyed.\n\nAnother accomplishment that we are proud of is learning many good team practices in coding, especially using git as a team, and maintaining different branches in an organized manner. We also learned all the tech we used for this project, including Beautiful Soup, Selenium, and all the Google APIs we had to use."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learned that altering some small sections of a website is a lot more work than it seems like.

So much food waste occurs in our dining halls on campus, but when you step back and think about how much food waste occurs across the nation's schools - that's a lot. And food waste is only one type of waste.\n\nThe world generates 2.01 billion tonnes of municipal solid waste annually, with the main waste categories being food/green, paper/cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal. Rapid urbanization, population growth, and economic development will push global waste generation to increase by 70% over the next 30 years. Thus, managing trash is critical to a sustainable future.\n\nBut how many people actually take the 5-10 minutes to research which type of waste their trash belongs into so we can manage waste better? That's where Germany, our inspiration, stepped in. In Germany, trash is strictly sorted into one of six bins: Blue (Paper and Cardboard), Yellow (Plastic and Soft Metal), Brown (Organic/Bio Waste), Black (Residual Waste), Red (Special Waste), and Glass (where glass is sorted into brown, white, or green glass). As the leading recycler of municipal waste, their comprehensive waste sorting system was something we digitally implemented so countries outside of Germany could easily follow the same model."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"In our web app, an user can upload an image of their trash. Our computer vision model, which we trained on multiples datasets using convolutional networks can identify a variety of different objects. Then, our program maps the identified object to the specific bin classification it falls under, taking into account bin prioritization for objects falling under multiple categories (ex. red would rank higher than blue). As a fail-safe, the user can also manually type in their trash (our autospell check would ensure accuracy of input) and then it could be mapped to it's classification. Given that there are a ginormous number of words that can fall under each category, we used nltk as a part of nlp to generate a giant database of synonyms and hyponyms to accommodate a wider range of inputs. Then, our web app would display the correct bin that the user needs to drop their trash into."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Computer Vision We need to be able to look at a disposed item and tell which of the six categories it belongs in. We developed an Image Classification Model that can sort objects to an extent: such as whether it's a fruit or vegetable, cardboard or plastic, type of electronic, etc. Most interestingly, Germany's trash management system sorts glass into three further categories: green glass, brown glass, and clear (white) glass. So I created an Image Segmentation Model too that segments an image and uses it average RGB value to figure out it's proper color.\n\nCloud Computing My computer didn't have enough storage for the sheer amount of training images to train the different models, so we ultilized AWS's S3 buckets to store and access our train, test, and validation data! This Cloud Computing solution ensured we could successfully train all the data we needed to given the time constraints of the Hackathon.\n\nNatural Language Processing Main Idea: Utilizing computer vision to analyze a user-inputted image, we generate a predicted name for the object in the image. The specific NLP task we implemented was \"named entity recognition\", which identifies words or phrases as useful entities. Using this predicted name, we categorized it into the different bins used in the German trash sorting system. First, we imported our necessary packages. For this part of the project, we used import csv, fileinput, autocorrect, webcolors, numpy, math, collections, and nltk.\n\nWhat is NLTK: NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) is a popular platform that works with language data. Utilizing semantic reasoning libraries, we reached a logical conclusion based on predicted name to generate synonyms and hyponyms for a pre-created set of potential trash items under each bin category. We did this in order to create a more expansive and inclusive data set that can accomodate a wider range of potential user images.\n\nSpecial Cases: One of our categories was glass, and in Germany, glass is categorized into green, brown, and white. Using webcolors, we converted given glass color into its rgb int values and cross-referenced these values to approximate which out of the three glass categories it would fit best in. Given that some objects could be present under multiple bins, we created an order of priority to properly sort these objects. And some objects, like paper, is a substring of many different trash items that fit into different bins (such as wax paper, toilet paper, paper towels, etc.). To overcome this issue, we prioritized the bin in which the inputted string exactly matched the data element. Furthermore, since some trash items could be contaminated with organic materials, we created a case where any object that was contaminated would automatically be sorted into residual waste. As a fail-safe in case the computer vision couldn't identify the object, we also created a functionality for the user to type their object. To account for misspellings, we also created an autocorrect function to correct user input.\n\nFront-End Development (React.js, 3D-Modeling, and Flask) For our front-end, we created an interative web-app where users can enter pictures of their trash or a description of their trash, and the output will be the respective bin it belongs too. While our backend code currently isn't linked to this front-end, we plan to learn Flask and implement it to accomplish this task."},{"heading":"Challenges and Accomplishments - what we learned","content":"Challenge #1: connecting our front end to our back end While we had a completed web app and a thoroughly functioning opencv/nlp model, our issue was trying to figure out how to integrate the two pieces together. We realized that using Flask was the best approach to tie our keras models into our web app, but unfortunately the learning curve was a little steep in our allotted time at the hackathon. With more time spent learning and executing our findings, we would be able to get this project full-stack!\n\nChallenge #2/Accomplishment #1: using NLTK to improve our waste classification dataset One issue we were thinking about was that when the user inputs a word to describe their waste, there could be a massive amount of possibilities of what they could input for the same waste. Thus, we figured out that we needed to use NLTK to generate a giant database of synonyms and hyponyms for each element in our original waste classification csv file and write a new file combining our original and newly generated database. We were able to get this working, thus it was a more accurate model for our users to interact and sort their waste!\n\nAccomplishment #2: Using AWS to train our opencv model To train our opencv model, our computer needed to handle massive datasets, but our computer didn't have enough storage for the sheer amount of training images to train the different models. Especially with a bin like brown (organic waste), there were so many possibilities of what compost could be. Thus we used AWS's S3 buckets to store and access these datasets. By using cloud computing, we were able to train and use a more accurate model within our allotted time at the hackathon."},{"heading":"What's next for Garbage Classification Model","content":"Using Flask to link our Backend with our FrontEnd Categorizing more items with our Image Classification Model(e.g. commonly disposed items like plastic utensils) Generating a more efficient algorithm to come up with more accurate synonyms and hyponyms for each element in our classification dataset, so we would cover almost all possible waste that could be thrown away."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"3dmodeling cnn css html imagesegmentation javascript natural-language-processing neuralnetworks nltk opencv python react.js"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Crypto Energy","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/crypto-energy","tagline":"Allowing an exchange of cryptocurrency through the blockchain to allow users of home energy efficiency mobile apps to better be able to finance their home energy improvement projects","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackIllinois 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackillinois-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Building on Cardano Blockchain Project"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"api","url":null},{"name":"blockchain","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/blockchain"},{"name":"bluehill","url":null},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"firebase","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/firebase"},{"name":"html","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/html"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Cryptocurrency is the next best fintech solution possible."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"(to be cont... edit in the morning, project is still in the works as of 3am, submitting now/editing later in a few hours... to be cont, thanks)"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"api blockchain bluehill css firebase html mongodb node.js"}]},{"project_title":"BirdBlog","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/birdblog","tagline":"BirdBlog is a web app that takes trending Twitter topics and transforms them into stunning blogs, using sentiment analysis and AI to generate relevant images and written content in real-time.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/002/398/605/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackIllinois 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackillinois-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Student Development Pack Track Project"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"axios","url":null},{"name":"azure","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/azure"},{"name":"bootstrap","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/bootstrap"},{"name":"css","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/css"},{"name":"doppler","url":null},{"name":"ejs","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/ejs"},{"name":"express.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/express-js"},{"name":"heroku","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/heroku"},{"name":"javascript","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/javascript"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"namecheap","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/namecheap"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"openai","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"birdblog.me","url":"https://birdblog.me/"},{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/YashTelang/BirdBlog"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"Sitting at the opening ceremony of Hack Illinois, our team was brainstorming ideas for a web application that could leverage the latest advances in artificial intelligence and natural language processing. As social media enthusiasts, we were drawn to the vast amounts of information and trends that were being generated on Twitter every day. However, we noticed that it could be challenging to keep up with the sheer volume of tweets, let alone understand the overall sentiment and themes that were emerging.\n\nThis sparked an idea: what if we could use AI to extract the most important information from Twitter and present it in a visually appealing and informative way? Thus, the concept of BirdBlog was born. With BirdBlog, we aimed to create a platform that could analyze trending Twitter topics, extract the most relevant tweets, and generate compelling content that could keep users informed and engaged.\n\nTo achieve this, we knew we needed to leverage the latest tools and techniques in natural language processing and sentiment analysis. We worked tirelessly to develop algorithms that could understand the sentiment of each tweet and identify the most significant themes and keywords. We also worked to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface that would make it easy for users to browse through the content and stay up-to-date on the latest trends.\n\nAfter countless hours of coding, testing, and refining, BirdBlog was finally created!"},{"heading":"What it does","content":"BirdBlog is a powerful web application that provides users with a unique and innovative way to stay informed about trending topics on Twitter. The platform leverages recent releases of artificial intelligence to create engaging and informative written and visual content on a wide range of subjects.\n\nThe first step in the implementation process was to parse trending conversations and discussions on Twitter. BirdBlog then incorporates algorithms to analyze the sentiment of tweets and other social media content related to the topic. By understanding the overall opinion of the community, BirdBlog can create content that accurately reflects the general sentiment of the discussion.\n\nOnce BirdBlog has a clear understanding of the topic and its sentiment, it generates written and visual content using the OpenAI API, specifically the GPT-3 and DALL-E models. These models are state-of-the-art in natural language processing and image generation, allowing BirdBlog to create high-quality content that is engaging and informative.\n\nThe content generated by BirdBlog is presented in a social media blog format. Each card includes a visually appealing image and a brief, informative summary of the topic. Users can easily browse through the cards and click on any that interest them to read more about the topic.\n\nBy utilizing AI and machine learning, BirdBlog creates content that is accurate, informative, and engaging, helping users stay up-to-date on the topics that matter most to them."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"From a technical standpoint, building BirdBlog was a complex process that required the integration of multiple APIs and tools.\n\nThe first step in the development process was creating a website that could host the application. We used Node.js and the Express package to create a server and a basic user interface.\n\nThe core of BirdBlog's functionality lies in its ability to generate content and images based on trending Twitter topics. To accomplish this, we integrated OpenAI's API, which allows us to generate text and images based on natural language processing and machine learning models. However, to ensure that the content generated by BirdBlog accurately reflects the sentiment of the Twitter community, we also integrated Microsoft Azure's sentiment analysis API. This API enables BirdBlog to determine whether the overall sentiment of a topic is positive or negative, allowing it to generate content that accurately reflects the community's views.\n\nInitially, we had planned to use Twitter's API to find the top trending hashtags and tweets corresponding to them to determine the topic and sentiment of our generated posts. However, we were unable to acquire a Twitter development key, so we manually created a dataset of topics and tweets for our page to randomly pick from.\n\nTo ensure that BirdBlog continuously generates new and fresh content, we created a cron-job that requests a new blog post from the site every minute, but this interval can be customized based on user preferences.\n\nSince BirdBlog uses GPT-3 and DALL-E’s OpenAI API, it is able to generate content related to trending topics much faster than humans. This directly allows BirdBlog to curate more accurate data at unprecedented speeds.\n\nBuilding BirdBlog required a combination of front-end and back-end development skills, integration with multiple APIs, and a deep understanding of natural language processing and machine learning. Despite the technical complexity, the end result is a powerful and innovative platform that helps users stay informed about the latest trends and discussions on Twitter."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"During the development process of BirdBlog, our team encountered several challenges that required creative solutions and workarounds. One of the most significant challenges we faced was obtaining a Twitter Developer Key. Unfortunately, the approval process for this key can take up to 48 hours, and we were unable to secure the key in time for our project. This obstacle forced us to manually create a dataset of topics and tweets for our platform to randomly choose from. We used the top trending topics on Twitter for inspiration, with a large dataset for real-time updates.\n\nAnother major challenge we faced was getting the sentiment analysis to work with the AI-generated images. While OpenAI's GPT-3 and DALL-E models are highly advanced, they do not always produce images that accurately match the sentiment of the topic. As a result, we had to invest a significant amount of time and effort in testing different keywords on DALL-E's API to find images that accurately matched the inputted topic.\n\nIn addition, we also faced technical issues related to the integration of the various APIs and tools we used in the development process. Getting the web application to create auto-generated blogs on a timer was quite difficult. We worked with mentors at the hackathon and looked at many online resources including Stack Overflow and YouTube for fixes.\n\nThrough and through, the development process for BirdBlog was challenging, the outcome and learning curve during this process was quite rewarding!"},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"As a team, we are incredibly proud of the work we accomplished with BirdBlog. One of our biggest accomplishments was successfully integrating multiple APIs to generate content and post it on a website. The combination of OpenAI's GPT-3 and DALL-E models with Microsoft Azure's sentiment analysis API allowed us to create a platform that delivers high-quality, AI-generated content that accurately reflects the sentiment of the Twitter community.\n\nWe are also proud of our ability to secure a domain name for the platform and use various tools from the GitHub Student Developer Pack (Doppler, Heroku, Microsoft Azure, Bootstrap Studio, Mongodb, Namecheap, Visual Studio Code) to build the project. By utilizing tools like Doppler and Heroku, we were able to streamline the development process and focus on creating the best possible user experience for our audience.\n\nIn addition to our technical achievements, our team also found the experience of working together on BirdBlog to be incredibly fulfilling and enjoyable. Each member of our team brought their own unique skills and expertise to the project, and it was inspiring to see these diverse talents come together to create something truly unique and innovative.\n\nCollaborating with team members from different backgrounds and skill sets allowed us to learn from each other, share our knowledge, and ultimately create a product that we are all proud of.

Therefore, coming up to speed with our front end framework, ReactJS, and integrating Python’s backend technologies, such as OpenCV and Tesseract, in combination with BlueHill Payment’s API was the biggest challenge that our team faced."},{"heading":"Future Goals","content":"We wanted to create an application that can be run on a variety of OS systems so there would be one unified application for payment sharing. As SplitIt is an application we would want people to use long-term, we believed some integral features to be implemented in the future included transaction & expense history, expense recommender based on the user’s interests and behavior, or a feature to quickly calculate and split tips. However, constrained by the time limit on the hackathon, the current version of SplitIt is a proof-of-concept application with the future goal of making it available on a variety of operating systems and devices."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Frontend Technologies: Though 2/3 of our team came in with prior knowledge of ReactJS, we were able to learn about various ReactJS packages and dive deeper into ReactJS’s usage of Hooks and Props in React components to create a more practical interface. Backend Technologies: Our team came into HackIllinois 2023 with very limited backend knowledge but a good foundation on Python. Learning and implementing OpenCV and Tesseract and integrating these libraries with the frontend interface in a limited period of time to create a fully functioning and efficient product was a feat we were all proud of accomplishing. API Usage: Despite having limited experience with BlueHill Payment’s API, we were able to quickly learn its features and leverage its powerful capabilities to create a seamless, user-friendly experience for our users. By leveraging the API's robust functionality, we were able to make SplitIt even more efficient allowing users to easily split bills and manage their finances without any hassle. Database Implementation: Despite having little prior experience with MongoDB, our team was able to pick it up at an impressive rate and use its robust features to develop a scalable and effective solution for managing expenses. We were able to easily store and retrieve data by utilizing MongoDB's adaptable document model and strong indexing system, ensuring that our application was quick and dependable for our users."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"Despite the fact that two-thirds of our team were novice hackers, we were able to rapidly pick up extensive libraries such as ReactJS and OpenCV. Though we had no prior knowledge of the BlueHill Payment API, we were able to seamlessly incorporate it into our backend infrastructure. Through countless hours of reading documentation and implementing various libraries, we were able to construct a robust, user-friendly web application that makes managing splitting bills easier. Apart from what we learned technically, we also gained a deeper understanding of the core fundamentals of online peer-to-peer transaction apps such as Venmo or CashApp. Through our development of SplitIt, we realized the importance of simplicity and user-friendliness in these applications, as well as the need for robust security measures to protect users' financial information. We also learned the value of real-time communication and notifications, which can help to ensure that transactions are completed smoothly and without delay. Through HackIllinois 2023, our team learned a tremendous amount about both frontend and backend technologies we used as well as effective teamwork and time management to produce a high-quality product. Ultimately, it was a fantastic experience, and we're excited to see what we'll be able to do next."},{"heading":"What's next for Split It","content":"With a finance platform such as SplitIt, there are multiple pathways to expand into in the future. Here are some initial ideas we had:\n\nCreating a Transaction History page to allow users to monitor their expense transactions over longer periods of time. This would allow users to easily track their payments and debts and keep track of expense patterns. Utilizing machine learning algorithms: SplitIt could analyze transaction data and user behavior to provide personalized recommendations for expenses. Implementing a section for groups and recurring payments: This feature would allow users to create groups for recurring expenses such as rent, utilities, or groceries. By setting up a group, users would not have to repeatedly add the same contacts each time they split a bill saving time and improving efficiency. Allowing transactions internationally between different currencies: Expand SplitIt’s services to allow users to split bills with friends and family who live in different countries and use different currencies. This would require an exchange rate calculation feature to ensure that the transactions are accurate and fair for all parties involved. Allowing cryptocurrency transactions: With the rise of cryptocurrency, SplitIt could add the option for users to split bills and send payments using popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. This would give users more payment options and could potentially attract a new demographic of users who prefer to use cryptocurrency for financial transactions."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"bluehill css html javascript mongodb opencv python react tesseract"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]}],"generated_at":"2026-02-18T16:45:55.173444Z"}}
