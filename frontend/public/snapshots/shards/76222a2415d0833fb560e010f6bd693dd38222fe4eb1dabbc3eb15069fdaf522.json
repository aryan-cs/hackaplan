You want them to come and help you, with the wave of a finger. We wanted to build an app that allows users to cast a “charm” to protect themselves, without having to directly interact with their phone."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Moco allows users to cast “charms”, which can be any user-specified event, such as waving your arms, or shaking your wrist. These charms then trigger user-specified actions, such as sending a text to your friend with your location, or calling your friend to come pick you.\n\nBy tapping into your phone or watch’s accelerometer, Moco can detect custom motion patterns. Once Moco detects these patterns, it triggers an action. Think of it as iPhone shortcuts, but you don’t even have to interact with your iPhone."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Using iOS’s CoreMotion framework, we can get access to the motion sensors of IOS devices, including the accelerometer and gyroscope. This data is logged and then streamed in the background to our Flask web server.\n\nUnder the hood, we implement two powerful algorithms for accurate charm-casting:: 1) Iterative Closest Point: we take moving averages from our time series and apply ICP to correct for rotation and translation. 2) Dynamic Time Warping: we then process the differences between the input stream and references, warping to account for temporal variance.\n\nUsing these algorithms, can detect if a user’s movement pattern matches any of their previously specified charms. If there is a match, our backend dispatches a command to the user’s iOS shortcuts to execute a specified action. We also built a web-app front end with React that allows users to visualize their charms, as well as input new custom charms and specify shortcut actions."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We had some difficulties wrangling with various iOS APIs. There are also some difficulties matching a previously specified charm with a user’s movements."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"Firstly, we are happy that we’ve developed a novel tech solution that addresses a number of societal problems that we don’t have good solutions for. For instance, when people find themselves in uncomfortable social situations, when people are in situations of imminent danger, or when they’ve simply had too much to drink.\n\nNext, we are proud of integrating various frameworks and technologies into our solution. We had to work with iOS APIs, Flask for our backend and React for our frontend. We also had to implement a technically complex pattern matching algorithm to match two different user actions. This was complicated by the inherent errors present in a device’s accelerometer and gyroscope. We also want to ensure detection even when the user performs the motion in a slightly different manner. It turns out that it is quite complex to determine the extent to which 2 3D motions are similar to each other."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"We learnt about the technical details of various iOS APIs and also the forms of motion data that iOS devices have access to. We learnt how to integrate various frontend and backend technologies into one cohesive project."},{"heading":"What's next for Moco","content":"We envision Moco to be a general app for all kinds of motion commands that grant people the power of telekinesis (almost). For example, harnessing the power of wearable tech, users will be able to turn on the light with a simple gesture.\n\nWe also envision Moco to be an app that empowers the disabled to benefit fully from modern technologies. For example, a person who is blind would be able to perform various daily tasks by instead gesturing with their wearable devices.\n\nWith further development work, we believe we will be able to add many more gestures and actions that can revolutionize how people interact with their personal devices."},{"heading":"Contact us","content":"monoid enquirer perplexed. .panda enigmatic719"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"javascript objective-c python pytorch react swift verbwire"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"Artie's Tale","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/artie-s-tail","tagline":"A fun and engaging educational game that provides an easy way for kids to get involved in caring for the environment.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackPrinceton Fall 2023","hackathon_url":"https://hackprinceton-fall-2023.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Beginner Hack"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"c#","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/c--2"},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"}],"external_links":[{"label":"drive.google.com","url":"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m5b2mGf6tfbk4p-u_w_denU34WfU_3eE/view"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"This game was inspired by a study performed by our school's chapter of Phi Theta Kappa.

Being students in college, we often find ourselves meticulously surfing the internet in hopes of relearning lectures/content that was difficult. Although we can do this, spending half an hour to sometimes multiple hours is simply not the most efficient use of time, and we often leave our computers more confused than how we were when we started."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"A typical scenario goes something like this: you begin a Google search for something you want to learn about or were confused by. As soon as you press search, you are confronted with hundreds of links to different websites, videos, articles, news, images, you name it! But having such a vast quantity of information thrown at you isn’t ideal for learning. What ends up happening is that you spend hours surfing through different articles and watching different videos, all while trying to piece together bits and pieces of what you understood from each source into one cohesive generalization of knowledge. What if learning could be made easier by optimizing search? What if you could get a guided learning experience to help you self-learn?\n\nThat was the motivation behind Bloom. We wanted to leverage generative AI to optimize search specifically for learning purposes. We asked ourselves and others, what helps them learn? By using feedback and integrating it into our idea, we were able to create a platform that can teach you a new concept in a concise, understandable manner, with a test for knowledge as well as access to the most relevant articles and videos, thus enabling us to cover all types of learners. Bloom is helping make education more accessible to anyone who is looking to learn about anything."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We faced many challenges when it came to merging our frontend and backend code successfully.

Deep Learning for Disease Classification\n\nTo tackle the complex issue of plant diseases, we leveraged deep learning algorithms. TensorFlow and PyTorch became our allies as we trained our model on extensive datasets of diseased and healthy crops, sourced from global agricultural research institutions.\n\n3. User-Friendly Interface\n\nUnderstanding that farmers may not be tech-savvy, we focused on creating an intuitive user interface. Feedback from potential users during the development phase was invaluable in refining the design for practicality and accessibility.\n\nChallenges Faced\n\nData Quality and Diversity : Acquiring diverse and high-quality datasets for training the deep learning model posed a significant challenge. Cleaning and preprocessing the data demanded meticulous attention. Real-Time Connectivity : Ensuring real-time connectivity in remote agricultural areas was challenging. We had to optimize our system to function efficiently even in low-bandwidth environments.

And buying isn't simple - would it look good on me? is always a question we have.\n\nThat's where SnapShop comes in—an intelligent assistant designed to address your fashion queries.\n\nOur personal experiences, like attending hackathons unprepared for the weather or dress code, highlighted the need for a solution. We recall a time at Calhacks where our lack of preparation led us to seek warmth sleeping near a bathroom (and getting woken up by the security)! SnapShop aims to prevent such fashion faux pas by providing weather-appropriate and event-specific style advice, ensuring you feel confident and appropriately dressed for any occasion, while keeping the bills bearable."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Click an image to Shop:\n\nSnapShop recognizes all the fashion items in the image and tells you what YOU need to buy, to get exactly the same look at the best deals.\n\nBasicaly, image -> best shopping links [demo link]\n\nAsk a query\n\nSay you don't know much about the outfit style you want to go with, for an event You can ask questions like \"I'm going to Mumbai, India for a wedding. It's a Gujarati family. I don't want to overdress. What should I wear?\" And voila, shopwise will generate a list of ethnic wear you should consider buying. ... or \"There's a tech meetup in San Fransisco. The meetup is about AI, I don't know if I should wear formal. I'm going next week. \" _ (Sent in November) SnapShop recognises that San Fransisco will be really cold, and that techies usually wear plain t-shirts.\n\nSo, it recommends semi-formal - buying plain t-shirts and a zip-up jacket, and a pant.\n\nAnother prompt: I'm going to mumbai in the summer, what should I wear?\n\nTRY IT ON ME\n\nUsers can also try clothes on themselves!

In these places, the connection between what we eat, our bodies, and the environment is highly emphasized. This experience ignited a passion within us to address the disconnect in food systems, prompting the creation of a solution that brings transparency, traceability, and healthier practices to the forefront of the food industry. Our goal is to empower individuals to make informed choices about their food, fostering a healthier society and a more sustainable relationship with the environment."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"There are two major issues that this app tries to address. The first is directed to those involved in the supply chain, like the producers, inspectors, processors, distributors, and retailers. The second is to the end user. For those who are involved in making the food, each step that moves on in the supply chain is tracked by the producer. For the consumer at the very end who will consume it, it will be a journey on where the food came from including its location, description, and quantity. Throughout its supply chain journey, each food shipment will contain a label that the producer will put on first. This is further stored on the blockchain for guaranteed immutability. As the shipment moves from place to place, each entity (\"producer, processor, distributor, etc\") will be allowed to make its own updated comment with its own verifiable signature and decentralized identifier (DiD). We did this through a unique identifier via a QR code. This then creates tracking information on that one shipment which will eventually reach the end consumer, who will be able to see the entire history by tracing a map of where the shipment has been."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"In order to build this app, we used both blockchain and web2 in order to alleviate some of the load onto different servers. We wrote a solidity smart contract and used Hedera in order to guarantee the immutability of the record of the shipment, and then we have each identifier guaranteed its own verifiable certificate through its location placement. We then used a node express server that incorporated the blockchain with our SQLite database through Prisma ORM. We finally used Firebase to authenticate the whole app together in order to provide unique roles and identifiers. In the front end, we decided to build a react-native app in order to support both Android and iOS. We further used different libraries in order to help us integrate with QR codes and Google Maps. Wrapping all this together, we have a fully functional end-to-end user experience."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"A major challenge that we ran into was that Hedera doesn't have any built-in support for constructing arrays of objects through our solidity contract.

We understand that this issue may take a lot of helping hand to build out, but it's really possible to make the world a better place. To the producers, distributors, and those helping out with the food, it helps them prevent outbreaks by keeping track of certain information as the food shipments transfer from one place to another.

We tried several things such as modifying our package.json, package-lock.json, reinstalling packages, uninstalling certain ones and consulted GitHub, StackOverflow, and chatgpt. The issues still persisted but we were able to resolve them. We had other issues with Node. Prompt engineering for GPT took some trial and error before getting it to output the desired content in the correct format. Especially because there are several steps to the video generation process, we needed to ensure that GPT reliably generates video scripts and image prompts. We also ran into issues with using image generation APIs due to content policy and moderation of the APIs. Stability AI doesn’t allow prompts with keywords related to children, something GPT might pick as example illustrations for the video. Similarly, OpenAI’s Dall-E API automatically revises prompts and the prompts that it itself revises violate OpenAI’s content policies. In addition to this, the Dall-E API has strict rate limits. These posed some challenges we had to overcome through carefully designed prompting, and handling of cases where certain images may be missing from the video."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We overcame the challenges we ran into to create a polished website that is fully functional.
