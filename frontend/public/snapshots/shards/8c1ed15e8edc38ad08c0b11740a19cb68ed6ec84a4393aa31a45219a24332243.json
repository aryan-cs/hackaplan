This is where prompt steps in."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"Rather than a user standing in front of a camera and talking to their audience with pre-prepared speeches, prompt will _ prompt _ you with a question that you will have a few seconds to think about before which you will have to answer it. This might seem a little bit intrusive at first, but it levels the playing field in the global community, and prevents users from putting up fake walls around themselves just for their audience on their social app.\n\nWith this comes added benefits. You can use this application as a private video journal and make as many personal entries as you like. This lets people \"scroll back\" on their life and reflect upon what they thought, how they matured, and enjoy nostalgia that the app is sure to bring."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"The front end was built in swift. The UI is not overly complicated and it is clean and easy to use. We took advantage of the numerous tools that xcode 7 has to offer which made the application design relatively painless. The back end however was the real meat of the project. We decided to build the backend in a way that we could essentially scale to millions of users instantly. We built the backend on top of kubernetes and amazon ec2 which allows us to dynamically stir up more servers when under high load. This is theoretically infinitely expandable. IN addition AWS and kubernetes, we took advantage of many cloud based tools which we deployed to our our cluster running on AWS."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"This project was built to scale larger than anything we had previously worked on. We used best practices from industry giants like Netflix and Apple to build our system. This was not easy to say the least. After reconfiguring the cluster over 100 times in 24 hours due to various routing and dependency issues. Finally we were able to call the cluster stable."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"The sheer magnitude of the project and how quickly we completed it is beyond comprehension. We took on this project as an exercise in building a real world scalable service. And we completed that goal despite none of us ever using swift or ios development before. And 2 of us never having attended a Hackathon before."},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"This whole experience taught us a lot. For one, ios development is very interesting and we can definitely see ourselves building ios applications again.

The launcher itself consists of two counter-rotating wheels, a magazine tube, a barrel, and a push rod to activate a shot.\n\nThe pan and tilt mechanism operates using one stepper motor per axis. Each stepper motor drives a timing belt which has ends fixed to a cylinder on the underside of each rotating axis. With 2026 total steps per revolution of each machine axis, this provides an accurate means of positioning the launcher. Concerns include over-travel as the pulley system is not a continuous loop. A potential fix is to keep track of absolute machine coordinates and relative machine coordinates, but has not been implemented due to time constraints.\n\nThe launcher mechanism went through an iterative design phase. The original goal being to launch Skittles, we pursued two parallel development paths: the first being the launcher currently used, and the second being a system based on a rotating disk attached to a fan motor taken from a microwave.\n\nThe second option had many drawbacks, one of them including the issue of shattering Skittles on contact instead of launching them. It also had no way to vary the angular velocity of the disk, which would severely limit tuning and distance compensation. This option was abandoned early on in favor of the counter-rotating wheel mechanism.\n\nThe final launcher presented consists of two counter-rotating brushless DC motors. Adhesive foam on the outside of the motors allows the system to grip the candy being fed into it and also takes up some of the variability in the size and shake of the candy. Candy is fed into a vertical magazine tube which deposits a single candy into the chamber. A servo acts as a push rod to manipulate the candy into the wheels while blocking the magazine. When the push rod retracts, another candy drops into the chamber. The wheels accelerate the candy and the candy gets funneled into the barrel. The barrel helps to minimize angular variability in launches. The speed of the motors is variable and allows for close-range launching or distances in excess of 20 feet."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"The cannon frame, launching mechanism, and, rotation mechanisms were made entirely by hand here."},{"heading":"What's next for Skyttle","content":"We are going to launch skittles and try to keep the cannon's aim and power as consistent as possible."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"arduino c css flask html javascript open-cv python quadcopter raspberry-pi raspberry-pi-camera"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"ec2-54-149-222-2.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com"}]},{"project_title":"I'mPacMan","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/i-mpacman","tagline":"You're Pacman, eat candies, watchout for ghosts","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_photos/000/307/048/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake2015.devpost.com/","prize_name":"6th - 10th Place"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"google-cardboard","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/google-cardboard"},{"name":"objective-c","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c"},{"name":"swift","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/swift"},{"name":"unity","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/unity"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"The classic 80's game, reinvented for a First Person nom-nom game."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"It generates orbs across the room you're in, and makes everybody else a ghost."},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"I build it in Unity3D, and Google Cardboard SDK."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"Getting the sensor readings accurately."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that I'm proud of","content":"We did it !!!!!"},{"heading":"What I learned","content":"Game development, multiple API integration, cross-platform build constructs."},{"heading":"What's next for I'mPacMan","content":"App Store, and Google Play Store"},{"heading":"Built With","content":"google-cardboard objective-c swift unity"}]},{"project_title":"Two Carts","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/two-carts","tagline":"Two Cards make it way too easy to split the bill with a friend at Walmart stores.","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/310/316/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake2015.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Walmart - Best Use of Walmart API"},{"hackathon_name":"BoilerMake","hackathon_url":"https://boilermake2015.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Qualcomm - Best Rookie Hack runner-up"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"iphone-sdk","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/iphone-sdk"},{"name":"mysql","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mysql"},{"name":"objective-c","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/objective-c"},{"name":"php","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/php"}],"external_links":[],"description_sections":[{"heading":"What is Two Carts?","content":"Two Carts is an app for shopping with friends.

Also, a long-term idea would be to let travel companies (American Airlines, MegaBus, etc.) pay for access to users' data (with their permission) and use it to advertise relevant trips within the app. For example, if I have 7 friends with hometowns in Chicago, I might get a notification from MegaBus that there's a sale on tickets to Chicago this weekend.
