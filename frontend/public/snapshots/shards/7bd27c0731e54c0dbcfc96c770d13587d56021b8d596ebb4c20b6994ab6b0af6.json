StreetSmart Cities is a platform which aims to do this, and includes a chat bot, collaborative work system, and data analytics from IoT APIs which work together to get us closer to the dream of smart cities."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"SmartCities is centered around collaboration, enabled by big data and cognitive services. City folk can log into the app to view information about their City SmartScore and their own SmartScore. These scores essentially relate to how involved the community, city, and themselves are in using technology to better their environment and make important decisions.\n\nUsers can log a task using the Microsoft Bot Service, which asks questions about the issue you want to raise; this may be a crime, advice, repair, etc... The bot will log this task, which other users can now see. The community is now able to work together to better their city.\n\nHowever, some tasks may require the assistance of public figures and government officials; this is where the Twitter API comes in, which allows users to track, retweet, and apply pressure to their city to get things done. In-app, anyone can share and retweet issues or complaints, which tag local government automatically (for example @Atlantacitygov). This platform therefore ensures that the city takes their constituents into consideration during the city planning process.\n\nHowever, the platform would be incomplete without the addition of IoT devices. Within both a data analytics section and an interactive map, users can see information about the city's pedestrian traffic, temperature, humidity, and cameras provided by GE Current. This allows the entire town to use these tools in an attempt to further their goal of making their city both safer and cleaner.\n\nTo learn more about what it does, I suggest checking out the screenshots above!"},{"heading":"How I built it","content":"I built StreetSmart Cities using the following technologies:\n\nGE Current API Azure + Bot Services WRLD3D + AR Maps AWS through Heroku Lottie for After Effects Twitter APIs Picasso + OkHttp3 Jupiter Notebook Django Domain.com (purchased http://streetsmartcity.org , to be linked)\n\nI started by getting a Django RESTful server up and running, and quickly made a few scripts to automatically generate data. Next, I spent time configuring the chat bot and tweaking it to what I was looking for. I then spent a lot of time preparing the basic infrastructure of the app, and making sure that each UI component was just right. After getting Twitter, Lottie, and WRLD3D integrated into the application, I went back to the server to begin some data mining with the GE Current API. After obtaining tons of data on temperature, humidity, and pedestrian behavior, I created endpoints to get that information, and integrated it into my application."},{"heading":"Challenges I ran into","content":"This was my first time competing in a hackathon by myself, and also the first time that I played around with chat bots, serious animation, Django, and 3D mapping.

We felt that there was an opening in the chat bot marketplace for providing personalized financial data and recommendations to every day users."},{"heading":"What it does","content":"STRAT acts the user a series of personality-based questions to assess his or her risk profile, using the answers to calculate a number between zero (most risk-averse) and one (least risk-averse). These answers define the profile of the user for interacting with STRAT. Then, on prompt from the user, the bot can either (1) provide information about a specific financial security (e.g. \"tell me about apple\") or (2) make recommendations that fit the calculated risk profile of the user (e.g. \"suggest a stock\")."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"The chat bot was built using the NodeJS implementation of the Microsoft Bot Framework. The bot runs on an Microsoft Azure instance and can be plugged into several different messaging services, such as Slack, Messenger, and Skype (or, more simply, on the Microsoft Bot Emulator). The bot invokes Python scripts on the back-end that fetch data from Blackrock's Aladdin REST API to be used to provide information about financial securities for the users and data for calculations about the risk of each security (so as to make the best recommendation to the user)."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"Definitions of the terms on the Aladdin API were few and far between, so we had to do a fair bit of research to determine what metrics were best suited for our purposes. The data from Aladdin, too, was not perfectly matched with our intentions, so we had to do some hacking to get the data and metrics we wanted without making a bajillion HTTP requests. Additionally, our group was much more comfortable to fetch data from Aladdin in Python instead of Node, so we had to use some creative workarounds to call the scripts we wrote from the app.js file. This inadvertently led to the Python integration (and thus the entire bot) failing much more than we would have liked. Finally, for the longest time we were running our bot on a purely free instance of Azure, which murdered the performance and responsiveness of our initial protoype. It was only until we set up our bot, with the help of a Microsoft employee, on an instance with a pass for credit that it became functional."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"This was the first real hackathon for most of the group, so to churn out a project we all found interesting and loved building is something we can tell our parents about.

While this may sound obvious and limited and scope, we believe it to be quite the opposite.\n\nThe immediate value should be readily apparent: optimizing basic parking in decks and lots for both city planners and consumers alike. With knowledge of which spots are full, consumers are able to find open areas more quickly and decks can simply close when they are full. While this in and itself is far from unique, we definitely believe in the value of the concept, and support it both with our own hardware and the potential for software integration.\n\nWe have built a proof of concept \"Doot\" - a wireless, battery powered parking spot monitor that interfaces with the growing API platform offered by Live Park. Doots should be rugged, reliable, and long lasting, all of which are traits we believe we have captured in our prototype model.\n\nThe Live Park central server is responsible for all aggregating the IoT level data provided out Doots and other sensors and surfacing easy to use APIs. It also acts as the gateway for interactions with the growing community of \"Smart City\" services and analytics.\n\nThe Live Park mobile application enables consumers to tap in to this wealth of information in the way most convenient to them. They can easily find Live Park enabled lots near them or their destinations, book a spot, and maybe one day, even pay for their parking, all while helping optimize the system as a whole.\n\nFinally, the Live Park web app enables the administrators of parking assets to view the live status of their entire lots/decks. Currently, this web app is part of the central server, but could de deployed separately with relatively little work if called for.\n\nWith a single comprehensive platform in place, it becomes easy to see how one might expand into additional markets. For example, we have already seen the impact of connecting directly with cars through GM's remote and in-vehicle APIs. Parking instructions can be transmitted directly to in-vehicle navigation, identity and payment validation can be handled automatically, and electric vehicles can automatically be given priority parking where charging is available.\n\nNow that the flowery pitch is done with, lets get in to some details."},{"heading":"How we built it","content":"Our prototype \"Doot\" runs on an Arduino Pro Mini, communicates wirelessly on 433 MHz, and detects cars using an infrared proximity sensor. It is battery powered and enclosed in a previously weather proof box.\n\nThe Live Park \"central server\" is written in GoLang. This choice was admittedly due to the team's familiarity with it. Even though it is a slower choice for rapid prototyping, it is one of the more performant languages in use, and using it forces us to be in the mindset of truly scalable production code. The central server currently communicates with the Doot base station (receiver) over serial, though this could change easily if the receiver was made to connect to the internet.\n\nThe consumer app was developed for Android in Android Studio.\n\nThe Web App is written primarily in JavaScript and makes heavy use of the Google Maps JS APIs."},{"heading":"Challenges we ran into","content":"We initially had a very, very hard time getting Android Studio up and running. None of us had ever written a mobile application before, and failing our way through the learning process took some time. While we did end up learning a lot, it felt like a lot of time was wasted to strange versioning issues that no one could quite explain to us.\n\nThe plan had been to build a pair of Doots to better demonstrate the technology, but apparently all but one of the 433 MHz Transceivers were \"snagged\" before parts checkout even began. This meant we had to spend some extra cycles figuring out how best to demo our single sensor, though I am sure it saved us time on construction and assembly.\n\nWe also had some issues reading data from our proximity sensors for a while, but it turned out just to be noise on the line due to a faulty connection. This really highlights what we found to be one of the hardest parts of embedded systems development: you can't always count on the hardware to work when trying to debug your software."},{"heading":"Accomplishments that we're proud of","content":"We put serious effort in to making our final proof of concept hardware as robust as possible. We are extremely proud of how reliable our device is, how professional it looks, and how solid it feels. We have all worked on some brittle hardware hacks in the past, and decided as a team to do things right this time.\n\nWe are also proud of the performance we were able to eek out of the hardware we had access to. Once we got the MVP up and running, we just kept optimizing until we were happy. As one example, one of our team members ran the numbers and built antennas for our generic transmitter/receiver combo and literally tripled our range.\n\nFinally, we are definitely pleased with how our mobile app turned out. It isn't anything fancy, but it is far, far better than we were hoping given the complete lack of app development experience on our team. Which leads quite nicely in to the next section..."},{"heading":"What we learned","content":"All of the team members are big fans of Google, but I think we all learned a lot about their ecosystem. This was the first time developing a mobile app for everyone on the team, and we dug pretty deep into the Google Maps API as well. I know Jared is excited to continue exploring mobile software development in the future."},{"heading":"What's next for Live Park","content":"The most obvious first step for Live Park would be to acquire more specialized hardware for building our Doots. We only use a tiny fraction of the bandwidth available on the radios provided at the Hackathon, and the proximity sensors require a break in the face of the otherwise water-proof casing. Different radio technology would use far less power while still having much better range, and anisotropic magnetoresistance sensors would let us detect cars based on their magnetic field alone. Additionally, burning all of the application logic and components onto a single SoC board would greatly reduce the size of the final product.\n\nAnother obvious fast follow would be an iOS brother to our Android App. And shortly after, CarPlay and Android Auto versions as well.\n\nFinally, the strategic play would arguably be the most important. Finding the right deals and partnerships (think Park Mobile) would help our technology get adopted as quickly as possible."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android arduino general-motors-remote golang google-maps javascript"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"JIRA Voice","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/jira-voice","tagline":"JIRA Voice is an Amazon Alexa Skill that interfaces with Atlassian's JIRA Platform.","preview_image_url":"https://d2dmyh35ffsxbl.cloudfront.net/assets/shared/devpost_social_icon_200_200-f56e5af715a1d95e0209bb37e899b7c18c6e7e3b933a3c1f52456a6e2ee85d09.jpg","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 2017","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2017.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Unleash the Potential Prize"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"alexa","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/alexa"},{"name":"amazon-alexa","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/amazon-alexa"},{"name":"node.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/node-js"},{"name":"rest-api","url":null}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/dbecker1/JIRA-Voice"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"As developers, we want to spend as much of our time coding as possible.

By seeing other peoples' interests, choose somebody (or even multiple people), and start a conversation! PassBy: If you pass by somebody in Philadelphia, and then pass by them again in a different city, you'll both be notified. Using a combination of Wifi, Bluetooth, Bluetooth LE, and ultrasonic sound frequencies, we're able to determine whether or not somebody else is near you; with little to no impact on battery life. After being notified, both parties are invited to chat if they so choose. Music: After making a little bit of music, be able to share music with those you pass by. By using the same technologies as PassBy, we are able to exchange little snippets of user created music when people pass by each other.

When connected with the airline's system, the application will also fill in a full list of services that can be put on the flight.\n\nIn addition, we created only one side to this application: the user-facing side. Ideally we want to have a business-facing application that is connected to this information. This enterprise app would allow for the airline to see the amount of each item requested for each flight allowing them to have a better idea of what to load on the plane, and to better facilitate existing models of prediction. This app would also have a schedule for the dedicated flight attendant, so they can serve the customers according to their requests.\n\nCurrently, this app is meant only to be a feature for First Class and above (Delta One). We want to offer a small subset of this experience to all classes that will give a rough schedule of when the flight crew will distribute amenities during the flight. For example, on a 15 hour flight, a customer would enjoy knowing that a meal is planning to come 1 hour in, so they would stay up for that instead of sleeping and missing the meal.\n\nFinally, in terms of technology, we built the current app on Android as a proof of concept but also plan to port it to iOS, and it would be ideal to also have it integrated in the website."},{"heading":"Built With","content":"android java"},{"heading":"Try it out","content":"github.com"}]},{"project_title":"DataDome","project_url":"https://devpost.com/software/datadome-jinc1t","tagline":"A machine learning approach to detect fraud","preview_image_url":"https://d112y698adiu2z.cloudfront.net/photos/production/software_thumbnail_photos/000/551/578/datas/medium.png","prizes":[{"hackathon_name":"HackGT 2017","hackathon_url":"https://hackgt2017.devpost.com/","prize_name":"Best Analysis and Development of Deep Connections With Finra's Dataset"}],"team_members":[],"built_with":[{"name":"d3.js","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/d3-js"},{"name":"flask","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/flask"},{"name":"machine-learning","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/machine-learning"},{"name":"mongodb","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/mongodb"},{"name":"python","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/python"},{"name":"scikit-learn","url":"https://devpost.com/software/built-with/scikit-learn"}],"external_links":[{"label":"github.com","url":"https://github.com/petosa/datadome"}],"description_sections":[{"heading":"Inspiration","content":"We decided to try Finra's Analytics challenge.
