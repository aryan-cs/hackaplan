Many thanks to the kind folks from Magnet and Azure (Microsoft) for helping us early in the morning or late at night. For the build we utilized the Magnet SDK to enable easy in-app messaging and receiving between users and a random sample of users. With the messages, we added and triggered a message 'send-event' based on the click of a judgement button or an ask button. When a message was received we sorted the message (either a message to be judged or a message that is a judgement). To ensure that all judgement messages corresponded to the proper question messages we used special hash ids and stored these ids in serialized data. We updated the Feed and the MyQuestions tab on every message receive.\n\nFor Azure we used logistic regression and a looooooooonnnnnnnnggggggg list of offensive and not offensive phrases. Then after training the set to create a model, we set up a web api that will be called by Politically Correct to get an initial sentiment analysis of the message."},{"heading":"Challenges We ran into","content":"Aside from the multiple attempts of putting foot in mouth, the biggest challenges came from both platforms: Azure : Perfectionism While developing a workflow for the app the question of \"How do I accurately predict the abuse in a statement?\" often arose. As this challenge probably provokes similar doubts from Ph.Ds we would like to point to perfectionism as the biggest challenge with Azure.\n\nMagnet: Impatience Ever the victims, we like to blame companies for putting a lot of words in their tutorials because it makes it hard for us to skim through (we can't be bothered with learning we want to DO!!). The tutorials and documentation provided the support and gave all of us the ability to learn to sit down and iterate through a puzzle until we understood the problem.

From contributing to the rises and falls of great civilizations to helping five sleep deprived hackers communicate over 36 hours, it has become a required dependency in the git@ssh.github.com : hacker/life .\n\nPlowing through the weekend, we found ourselves shortchanged by the current available tools for collaborating within a cluster of devices. Every service requires:\n\nAuthentication Users must sign up and register to use a service. Contact People trying to share information must establish a prior point of contact(share e-mails, phone numbers, etc). Unlinked Output Shared content is not deep-linked with mobile or web applications.\n\nThis is where Grasshopper jumps in. Built as a streamlined cross-platform contextual collaboration service , it uses our on-prem installation of Magnet on Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Messaging to integrate deep-linked commands and execute real-time applications between all mobile and web platforms located in a cluster near each other. It completely gets rid of the overhead of authenticating users and sharing contacts - all sharing is done locally through gps-enabled devices."},{"heading":"Use Cases","content":"Grasshopper lets you collaborate locally between friends/colleagues. We account for sharing application information at the deepest contextual level, launching instances with accurately prepopulated information where necessary. As this data is compatible with all third-party applications, the use cases can shoot through the sky. Here are some applications that we accounted for to demonstrate the power of our platform:\n\nShare a video within a team through their mobile's native YouTube app in seconds . Instantly play said video on a bigger screen by hopping the video over to Chrome on your computer. Share locations on Google maps between nearby mobile devices and computers with a single swipe. Remotely hop important links while surfing your smartphone over to your computer's web browser.
